      response: 'To answer this question, let''s break it down into steps:


        1. **Identify the locations**: Missouri State University is located in Springfield,
        Missouri, while Drury University is also located in Springfield, Missouri.


        2. **Understand the geography of Springfield, Missouri**: Springfield is a
        city in southwestern Missouri. It''s important to note that both universities
        are located in the same city, which simplifies the geographical analysis.


        3. **Compare the locations**: Since both universities are in the same city,
        we need to consider their specific locations within Springfield.


        4. **Use mapping or geographical data**: Without specific addresses, we can
        still consider that both universities are in Springfield. However, to give
        a precise answer, we would ideally look up the exact addresses or locations
        of both universities on a map.


        Given the information and without access to real-time mapping data in this
        response, I''ll proceed based on general knowledge:


        - Missouri State University is located at 901 S. National Ave., Springfield,
        MO 65897.

        - Drury University is located at 900 N. Benton Ave., Springfield, MO 65802.


        Considering their addresses:

        - Missouri State University is on National Ave., which is more south and potentially
        east given the layout of Springfield''s streets.

        - Drury University is on Benton Ave., which is more north and potentially
        west given the layout of Springfield''s streets.


        Based on this, it appears that Missouri State University could be east of
        Drury University, considering their relative positions on the map of Springfield.

          East Bay (in Hayward, CA), and San Jose State University (in San Jose, CA),
          both of which are in the Bay Area but specifically in the East Bay and South
          Bay, respectively. Given the name, if we were to consider a university in
          the "South Bay" area, we might think of institutions like San Jose State
          University or other colleges in the South Bay region.


          4. **Comparison**: Since Apple University is in Cupertino, which is in the
          South Bay, and if we consider California South Bay University to be a hypothetical
          or a misnomer for a university in the South Bay area (like San Jose State
          University), we''re essentially comparing two locations within the same
          general region.


          5. **Conclusion**: Given that both are in the South Bay area of California,
          the question of one being "east" of the other depends on their exact locations
          within the South Bay. Cupertino (Apple University) is generally west of
          San Jose (if we use San Jose State University as a reference for a South
          Bay university). Therefore, Apple University would not be east of a university
          located in San Jose or a similar location in the South Bay.


          Based on this reasoning, the answer to whether Apple University, CA is located
          east of California South Bay University, CA would be: **NO**'

        response: 'To answer this question, let''s break it down step by step:


          1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
          Apple University and California South Bay University. However, it''s crucial
          to note that "Apple University" is not a traditional university in the sense
          of an educational institution offering degrees like a typical college or
          university. Apple University is actually an internal training program for
          Apple Inc. employees, located at the company''s headquarters in Cupertino,
          California.


          2. **Location of Apple University**: Cupertino, where Apple University is
          based, is in the South Bay area of the San Francisco Bay Area in California.


          3. **Location of California South Bay University**: There isn''t a well-known
          or prominent university by the exact name "California South Bay University"
          in California. However, there are institutions like California State University,
          East Bay (in Hayward, CA), and San Jose State University (in San Jose, CA),
          both of which are in the Bay Area but specifically in the East Bay and South
          Bay, respectively. Given the name, if we were to consider a university in
          the "South Bay" area, we might think of institutions like San Jose State
          University or other colleges in the South Bay region.


          4. **Comparison**: Since Apple University is in Cupertino, which is in the
          South Bay, and if we consider California South Bay University to be a hypothetical
          or a misnomer for a university in the South Bay area (like San Jose State
          University), we''re essentially comparing two locations within the same
          general region.


          5. **Conclusion**: Given that both are in the South Bay area of California,
          the question of one being "east" of the other depends on their exact locations
          within the South Bay. Cupertino (Apple University) is generally west of

        \   - Concordia University Texas is located in Austin, Texas.\n   - Phillips\
        \ University is located in Enid, Oklahoma.\n\n2. **Understand the geography\
        \ of Texas and Oklahoma**: Texas and Oklahoma are neighboring states in the\
        \ southern central part of the United States. \n   - Texas is a large state\
        \ with various regions, but for our purposes, we're focusing on the relative\
        \ east-west positions of these two locations.\n   - Oklahoma is a smaller\
        \ state, but it's important to understand its geography as well.\n\n3. **Compare\
        \ the locations**:\n   - Austin, Texas (where Concordia University Texas is\
        \ located) is in the central part of the state, near the border with Oklahoma.\n\
        \   - Enid, Oklahoma (where Phillips University is located) is in the northern\
        \ part of the state, near the border with Kansas.\n\n4. **Determine east-west\
        \ positioning**: Generally, in the United States, as you move from west to\
        \ east, you go from the Pacific coast towards the Atlantic coast.\n   - Austin,\
        \ Texas (Concordia University Texas) is more westward compared to Enid, Oklahoma\
        \ (Phillips University), which is more eastward.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based\

          2. **Consider the geography**: New York is a state in the northeastern part
          of the United States. Within the state, there are various cities and regions.


          3. **Specific locations**: Sophie Davis School of Biomedical Education is
          part of the City University of New York (CUNY), located in Manhattan, New
          York City. The Rockefeller University is also located in Manhattan, New
          York City.


          4. **Compare the locations**: Manhattan is a densely populated borough of
          New York City, and both Sophie Davis School of Biomedical Education and
          The Rockefeller University are located within it. However, "west" is a relative
          term and can be ambiguous in a densely populated urban area like Manhattan.


          5. **Conclusion**: Given that both institutions are located in Manhattan,
          and the term "west" can be subjective in such a densely populated area,
          it is difficult to determine whether Sophie Davis School of Biomedical Education
          is located strictly west of The Rockefeller University. Therefore, the answer

      response: 'To answer this question, let''s break it down into steps:


        1. **Identify the locations**: The Rockefeller University is located in Manhattan,
        New York City, and Sophie Davis School of Biomedical Education is also located
        in Manhattan, New York City.


        2. **Determine the geographical positions**: Manhattan is an island, and both
        institutions are located on the same island. The question asks if The Rockefeller
        University is located west of Sophie Davis School of Biomedical Education.


        3. **Consider the layout of Manhattan**: Manhattan is roughly a rectangular
        island, with the Hudson River to the west and the East River to the east.
        Most of Manhattan''s streets are laid out in a grid pattern, with avenues
        running north-south and streets running east-west.


        4. **Determine the relative positions**: To determine if The Rockefeller University
        is located west of Sophie Davis School of Biomedical Education, we need to
        consider their positions relative to each other on the island of Manhattan.


        5. **Conclusion**: Since both institutions are on the same island and likely
        not very far apart, it''s unlikely that one is significantly west of the other
        in a geographical sense. However, without specific addresses or knowing the
        exact layout of these institutions within Manhattan, it''s challenging to
        provide a definitive answer.


        Given the information available and the need for a clear YES or NO answer,
        I would lean towards a "NO" answer. This is based on the assumption that both
        institutions are in close proximity within Manhattan, and without specific
        addresses to determine their exact relative positions, it''s unlikely that
        one is significantly west of the other in a geographical sense that implies

      response: 'To answer this question, we need to identify the locations of The
        Rockefeller University and Sophie Davis School of Biomedical Education, and
        then determine their relative positions.


        1. **Location of The Rockefeller University**: The Rockefeller University
        is located in New York City, specifically on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.


        2. **Location of Sophie Davis School of Biomedical Education**: Sophie Davis
        School of Biomedical Education is also located in New York City, specifically
        in Harlem, which is in northern Manhattan.


        3. **Determine relative positions**: Since both institutions are in New York
        City, we need to consider their locations within the city. The Upper East
        Side of Manhattan is generally considered to be east of Harlem.


        Given these steps, we can conclude that The Rockefeller University is not
        located west of Sophie Davis School of Biomedical Education. In fact, it''s
        located east of Sophie Davis School of Biomedical Education, as the Upper
        East Side of Manhattan is east of Harlem.

      response: 'To answer this question, we need to determine the locations of Drury
        University and Missouri State University, and then compare their positions
        relative to each other.


        1. **Location of Drury University**: Drury University is located in Springfield,
        Missouri.


        2. **Location of Missouri State University**: Missouri State University is
        also located in Springfield, Missouri.


        3. **Comparison**: Since both universities are in the same city (Springfield),
        they are essentially in the same location. However, the question asks if Drury
        University is located west of Missouri State University.


        Given that they are in the same city, it''s unlikely that one is significantly
        west of the other in terms of large geographical distances, as they are both
        contained within the same city limits. However, without precise addresses
        or knowing the exact layout of these universities within Springfield, it''s
        a bit challenging. But considering they are both in Springfield, it''s reasonable
        to infer that one is not significantly west of the other in terms of large
        geographical distances.


        However, for the sake of providing a clear YES or NO answer based on the most
        logical deduction given the information:


        - If Drury University and Missouri State University are in the same city (Springfield),
        and without specific addresses to determine their exact relative positions,
        it''s a close call. But typically, when two locations are in the same city,
        they are not considered to be "west" of each other in a geographical sense
        that implies a significant distance.


        Given this, the most straightforward answer based on their shared location
        in Springfield, Missouri, would lean towards a "NO" because they are not in
        different geographical areas that would clearly define one as being west of
        the other in a broader sense. However, this answer assumes that their locations
        within Springfield do not have one significantly to the west of the other,
        which is a reasonable assumption given the context of the question.


        Therefore, the answer is: **NO**'

        it's "challenging to definitively say one is west of the other" and that they
        are "not considered to be 'west' of each other in a geographical sense that

          College of Design is located in Pasadena, California.


          2. **Geographical Orientation**: California is a large state with diverse
          geography. The eastern part of the state would be closer to the Nevada and
          Arizona borders, while the western part would be closer to the Pacific Ocean.


          3. **Comparative Location**: Since the question does not specify a particular
          CSU campus, we''ll consider the system as a whole. CSU campuses are spread

        response: 'To determine whether California State University (CSU) is located
          east of Art Center College of Design (ACCD), let''s break down the steps:


          1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the specific locations
          of both institutions. California State University is a system of public
          universities in California, with multiple campuses throughout the state.
          Art Center College of Design is located in Pasadena, California.


          2. **Location of California State University**: Given that CSU is a system
          with multiple campuses, we need to consider the specific campus being referenced.
          If we assume the question is referring to the main campus or a central location
          for CSU, we can consider the CSU Chancellor''s Office, which is located
          in Long Beach, California.


          3. **Location of Art Center College of Design**: ACCD is located in Pasadena,
          California, which is in Los Angeles County.


          4. **Geographical Comparison**: Long Beach (CSU) is generally south and
          slightly west of Pasadena (ACCD), given their positions in Southern California.
          The two cities are separated by the Los Angeles metropolitan area.


          5. **Conclusion**: Based on their geographical locations, California State
          University (Long Beach) is not east of Art Center College of Design (Pasadena).

        final_answer: 'NO'
        response: 'To answer this question, let''s break it down step by step:


          1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both

          it''s important to note that California State University is a system of
          multiple universities throughout California, so we need to specify which
          CSU campus we''re referring to.


          2. **Location of California State University**: Since California State University
          is a system, let''s consider a prominent CSU campus, like California State
          University, Long Beach (CSULB), which is located in Long Beach, California.


          3. **Location of Art Center College of Design**: Art Center College of Design
          is located in Pasadena, California, which is in the Los Angeles metropolitan
          area.


          4. **Comparison**: To determine if CSU is located east of Art Center College
          of Design, we need to compare their geographical positions. Long Beach (CSULB)
          is generally south of Pasadena (Art Center College of Design). However,
          the question asks if CSU is east of Art Center College of Design.


          5. **Conclusion**: Given that Long Beach is south of Pasadena, it means
          that CSU (in this case, CSULB) is not east of Art Center College of Design.

      response: "To determine if Art Center College of Design, CA is located east\
        \ of California State University, CA, let's break it down:\n\n1. **Identify\
        \ the locations**: \n   - Art Center College of Design is located in Pasadena,\
        \ California.\n   - California State University has multiple campuses across\
        \ California, but the main campus is in Long Beach, California.\n\n2. **Understand\
        \ California's geography**: California is a large state in the western United\
        \ States. It's important to understand that \"east\" and \"west\" are relative\
        \ terms in California due to its size and the fact that it borders the Pacific\
        \ Ocean to the west.\n\n3. **Compare the locations**: \n   - Pasadena (Art\
        \ Center College of Design) is in Los Angeles County.\n   - Long Beach (California\
        \ State University) is in Los Angeles County.\n\n4. **Determine east-west\
        \ positioning**: \n   - Generally, in California, as you move east, you move\
        \ away from the Pacific Ocean. However, within Los Angeles County, Pasadena\
        \ and Long Beach are not drastically different in terms of their east-west\
        \ positions. They are both relatively westward within the county.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\
        \ Based on their locations within Los Angeles County, Art Center College of\
        \ Design in Pasadena is not significantly east of California State University\
        \ in Long Beach. Therefore, Art Center College of Design is not east of California\

        Given that they are both in Charlottesville, it''s challenging to determine

        - If both institutions are in the same city (Charlottesville), and without

        call. But typically, when two locations are in the same city, they are not
        considered to be "west" of each other in a geographical sense that implies
        a significant distance.


        Given this, the most straightforward answer based on their shared location
        in Charlottesville, Virginia, would lean towards a "NO" because they are not
        in different geographical areas that would clearly define one as being west

        University of Virginia Center for Politics and the International Residential
        College, and then compare their positions relative to each other.


        1. **Location of University of Virginia Center for Politics**: The University
        of Virginia Center for Politics is located in Charlottesville, Virginia. Charlottesville
        is situated in the central part of Virginia.


        2. **Location of International Residential College**: The International Residential
        College is also located in Charlottesville, Virginia. It is part of the University
        of Virginia.


        3. **Comparison**: Since both institutions are based in Charlottesville, Virginia,
        they are essentially in the same location. However, the question asks if the
        University of Virginia Center for Politics is located west of the International
        Residential College.


        Given that they are in the same city, it''s reasonable to infer that one is
        not significantly west of the other in terms of large geographical distances,
        as they are both contained within the same city limits. However, without specific
        addresses or knowing the exact layout of these institutions within the city,
        it''s a bit challenging. But considering they are both in Charlottesville,
        it''s reasonable to infer that they are not significantly west of each other.


        Therefore, the answer is: **NO**'

        in the same city, Charlottesville, Virginia" and "they are not significantly
        west or east of each other in terms of geographical distance." The model's
        reasoning for the NO answer is that "they are in the same city, it's not appropriate
        to say one is west of the other in a geographical sense." This indicates the
        model is saying NO because it considers the locations to be essentially the

        of the University of New England, we need to consider their relative positions
        on a map. Both Ipswich, Massachusetts, and Biddeford, Maine, are located in
        the northeastern part of the United States.


        4. **Geographical Analysis**: Ipswich, Massachusetts, is located on the Atlantic
        coast, while Biddeford, Maine, is also on the Atlantic coast but further north.
        Given their positions on a map, Ipswich is generally located west of Biddeford.


        5. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical analysis, Ipswich Female Seminary,
        which was located in Ipswich, Massachusetts, is indeed located west of the
        University of New England''s Biddeford campus in Maine.

      response: 'To answer this question, we need to determine the locations of Ipswich
        Female Seminary and University of New England, and then compare their positions

        1. **Location of Ipswich Female Seminary**: Ipswich Female Seminary was a
        historic institution located in Ipswich, Massachusetts. However, it''s important
        to note that Ipswich Female Seminary is no longer in operation and has been
        defunct for many years. Therefore, its current location is not relevant for
        this question.


        2. **Location of University of New England**: The University of New England
        is located in Biddeford, Maine. It has campuses in Biddeford and Portland,
        Maine.


        3. **Comparison**: Since Ipswich Female Seminary is no longer in operation,
        its location is not relevant for the comparison. The University of New England
        is located in Maine, which is north of Massachusetts.


        Based on the locations of these institutions, we can conclude that Ipswich
        Female Seminary is not located west of the University of New England. This
        is because the University of New England is located in Maine, which is north
        of Massachusetts where Ipswich Female Seminary was located. Therefore, the
        University of New England is not west of Ipswich Female Seminary.

        is part of Texas Tech University. It is located in Lubbock, Texas.


        2. **Location of Texas Tech University College of Agricultural Sciences &
        Natural Resources**: The College of Agricultural Sciences & Natural Resources
        is also part of Texas Tech University and is located in Lubbock, Texas.


        3. **Comparison**: Since both institutions are part of Texas Tech University
        and are located in Lubbock, Texas, they are essentially in the same location.
        The question asks if Whitacre College of Engineering is located west of the
        College of Agricultural Sciences & Natural Resources.


        Given that they are both within the same university and city, it''s safe to
        assume that they are not significantly west of each other in a geographical
        sense that would imply a large distance. In fact, they are likely in close
        proximity within the university''s campus.


        Therefore, the answer is: **NO**'

          1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
          institutions. MSUSA is associated with Minnesota State University, which
          has multiple campuses across Minnesota. NSU is located in Natchitoches,
          Louisiana.


          2. **Compare Locations**: Minnesota is located in the Upper Midwest region
          of the United States, while Louisiana is in the southern part of the country.
          Natchitoches, where NSU is located, is in the central-western part of Louisiana.


          3. **Geographical Orientation**: When comparing locations, it''s essential
          to consider the broader geographical context. In this case, we''re looking
          at a location in the Upper Midwest (Minnesota) and a location in the southern
          part of the United States (Louisiana).


          4. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical layout of the United States,
          Minnesota is located significantly north of Louisiana. This means that Minnesota
          State University Student Association (MSUSA) would not be located east of
          Northwestern State University (NSU), but rather north and slightly west.

          (NSU).


          2. **Minnesota State University Student Association**: The Minnesota State
          University Student Association represents students from various campuses
          within the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities system. The system
          has campuses across Minnesota, so it''s essential to clarify that the "Minnesota

          4. **Comparative Locations**: To determine if MSUSA is located east of NSU,
          we need to consider the general locations of Minnesota and Louisiana. Minnesota
          is in the northern central part of the United States, while Louisiana is

          5. **East/West Relationship**: When looking at the map of the United States,
          Louisiana is generally south and slightly west of Minnesota. However, since
          the question asks specifically about being "east" of NSU, we need to consider
          the broader context. From a national perspective, Louisiana is indeed east
          of Minnesota, but this is due to the curvature of the United States'' landmass,
          not because Louisiana is directly east of Minnesota.


          6. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical positions of Minnesota and
          Louisiana, and considering that the question is about the relationship between
          MSUSA and NSU, we can conclude that MSUSA is not located east of NSU. Instead,

        final_answer: 'YES'
        response: 'To answer this question, let''s break it down into steps:


          1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
          Minnesota State University Student Association (MSUSA) and Northwestern
          State University (NSU).


          2. **Location of MSUSA**: Minnesota State University Student Association
          is an organization representing students at Minnesota State University.
          The university has multiple campuses, but the main campus is in Mankato,
          Minnesota. Mankato is located in southern Minnesota, near the border with
          Iowa.


          3. **Location of NSU**: Northwestern State University is located in Natchitoches,
          Louisiana. Natchitoches is situated in the western part of Louisiana, near
          the border with Texas.


          4. **Compare Locations**: To determine if MSUSA is east of NSU, we need
          to consider the relative positions of Mankato, Minnesota, and Natchitoches,
          Louisiana. Mankato is significantly north and slightly east of Natchitoches,
          given that Minnesota is generally north of Louisiana.


          5. **Conclusion**: Based on their geographical positions, Minnesota State
          University Student Association (MSUSA), located in Mankato, Minnesota, is
          indeed east (and significantly north) of Northwestern State University (NSU),
          located in Natchitoches, Louisiana.

      response: 'To determine whether Northwestern State University, LA, is located
        east of Minnesota State University Student Association, MN, let''s break down
        the process:


        1. **Identify the locations**: Northwestern State University is located in
        Louisiana (LA), and Minnesota State University Student Association is in Minnesota
        (MN).


        2. **Understand the geography of the United States**: Louisiana is a state
        in the southern part of the United States, while Minnesota is a state in the
        northern part of the country.


        3. **Consider the east-west orientation**: In the United States, moving from
        west to east generally means moving from the Pacific Ocean towards the Atlantic
        Ocean.


        4. **Compare the locations**: Louisiana is more southerly than Minnesota,
        and both states are east of the Mississippi River. Minnesota is generally
        east of Louisiana, but the comparison here is not between states but between
        specific institutions within those states.


        5. **Specific locations within the states**: Northwestern State University
        is located in Natchitoches, Louisiana, which is in the central-western part
        of the state. Minnesota State University Student Association is located in
        Mankato, Minnesota, which is in the southern-central part of the state.


        6. **Relative east-west positioning**: Considering the locations within their
        respective states, Northwestern State University in Louisiana is not east
        of Minnesota State University Student Association in Minnesota. The two institutions
        are in different states with different relative east-west positions.


        The answer is: **NO**'

        in Santa Ana, California.


        2. **Determine the geographical positions**: Both institutions are in Santa
        Ana, California, which is a city located in Orange County, California. They
        are in the same general area.


        3. **Consider the question''s focus**: The question asks if California Coast
        University is located west of Rancho Santiago Community College District.
        This means we need to determine their relative positions within Santa Ana.


        4. **Compare their relative positions**: Given that both institutions are
        in Santa Ana, they are likely not significantly west of each other. Santa
        Ana is a relatively compact city, so it''s unlikely that one institution would
        be located significantly west of the other.

        \ their relative positions. However, without precise addresses or knowing\
        \ the exact layout of these institutions within the city, it's a bit challenging.\
        \ But considering they are both in Santa Ana, it's reasonable to infer that\
        \ one is not significantly west of the other in terms of large geographical\
        \ distances, as they are both contained within the same city limits.\n\nHowever,\
        \ for the sake of providing a clear YES or NO answer based on the most logical\
        \ deduction given the information:\n\n- If California Coast University and\
        \ Rancho Santiago Community College District are in the same city (Santa Ana),\
        \ and without specific addresses to determine their exact relative positions,\
        \ it's a close call. But typically, when two locations are in the same city,\
        \ they are not considered to be \"west\" of each other in a geographical sense\
        \ that implies a significant distance.\n\nGiven this, the most straightforward\
        \ answer based on their shared location in Santa Ana, California, would lean\
        \ towards a \"NO\" because they are not in different geographical areas that\
        \ would clearly define one as being west of the other in a broader sense.\
        \ However, this answer assumes that their locations within Santa Ana do not\
        \ have one significantly to the west of the other, which is a reasonable assumption\
        \ given the context of the question.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: **NO**"

          1. **Identify the locations**: Lincoln Christian University is in Lincoln,

          2. **Understand the geography**: Both universities are located in the same
          city, Lincoln, Illinois.

          3. **Consider the direction**: The question asks if Lincoln Christian University
          is located west of Lincoln College.

          4. **Compare locations**: Since both universities are in the same city,
          their relative locations are not necessarily east-west. They could be north-south,
          or even diagonally positioned.

          5. **Conclusion**: Given that both universities are in the same city, it''s
          difficult to determine if one is strictly west of the other. However, in
          general, locations that are in the same city are not typically considered
          to be strictly "west" of each other.

        1. **Identify the locations**: Lincoln College is located in Lincoln, Illinois,
        and Lincoln Christian University is also located in Lincoln, Illinois.


        2. **Consider the relative positions**: Since both institutions are in the
        same city, Lincoln, Illinois, their relative positions are very close. To
        determine if one is west of the other, we need to look at their specific locations
        within Lincoln.


        3. **Assess the city''s layout**: Lincoln, Illinois, is a relatively small
        city. Without specific addresses or a detailed map, it''s difficult to say
        whether one institution is significantly west of the other within the city
        limits.


        4. **Assumption based on proximity**: Given that both institutions are in
        the same city, and without precise addresses or a map showing their exact
        locations, it''s reasonable to assume that they are not significantly west
        of each other in a geographical sense. Typically, when two locations are in
        the same city, they are not considered to be "west" of each other in a way
        that implies a significant distance.


        Therefore, based on the information provided and the assumption that they
        are not significantly west of each other within Lincoln, Illinois, the answer
        to the question is: **NO**'

      response: 'To answer this question, we need to determine the locations of Lincoln
        College and Lincoln Christian University, and then compare their positions
        relative to each other.


        1. **Location of Lincoln College**: Lincoln College is located in Lincoln,
        Illinois.


        2. **Location of Lincoln Christian University**: Lincoln Christian University
        is also located in Lincoln, Illinois.


        3. **Comparison**: Since both institutions are based in Lincoln, Illinois,
        they are essentially in the same location. However, the question asks if Lincoln
        College is located west of Lincoln Christian University.


        Given that they are in the same city and likely very close to each other,
        the specific locations within Lincoln, Illinois, would determine their relative
        positions. However, without precise addresses or knowing the exact layout
        of these institutions within the city, it''s a bit challenging. But considering
        they are both in Lincoln, it''s reasonable to infer that one is not significantly
        west of the other in terms of large geographical distances, as they are both
        contained within the same city limits.


        However, for the sake of providing a clear YES or NO answer based on the most
        logical deduction given the information:


        - If Lincoln College and Lincoln Christian University are in the same city
        (Lincoln, Illinois), and without specific addresses to determine their exact
        relative positions, it''s a close call. But typically, when two locations
        are in the same city, they are not considered to be "west" of each other in
        a geographical sense that implies a significant distance.


        Given this, the most straightforward answer based on their shared location
        in Lincoln, Illinois, would lean towards a "NO" because they are not in different
        geographical areas that would clearly define one as being west of the other
        in a broader sense. However, this answer assumes that their locations within
        Lincoln do not have one significantly to the west of the other, which is a
        reasonable assumption given the context of the question.


        Therefore, the answer is: **NO**'

        in question is in Georgia, and it''s likely referring to South University''s
        Savannah campus, which is located in Savannah, Georgia.


        2. **Location of Ralston College**: Ralston College is also located in Savannah,
        Georgia. It''s a relatively new liberal arts college that offers undergraduate
        programs.


        3. **Comparison**: Since both institutions are based in Savannah, Georgia,
        they are essentially in the same location. However, the question asks if South
        University is located west of Ralston College.


        Given that they are in the same city and likely very close to each other,

        However, for the sake of providing a clear YES or NO answer based on the most

        they are not considered to be "west" of each other in a geographical sense
        that implies a significant distance.


        Given this, the most straightforward answer based on their shared location
        in Savannah, Georgia, would lean towards a "NO" because they are not in different

      response: 'To answer this question, we need to determine the locations of South
        University and Ralston College and compare their positions relative to each
        other.


        1. **Location of South University**: South University is located in multiple
        cities across the United States, including Atlanta, Georgia.


        2. **Location of Ralston College**: Ralston College is located in Savannah,
        Georgia.


        3. **Comparison**: Since South University has campuses in different cities,
        we need to consider the specific location of the campus in question. However,
        since both institutions are in Georgia, we can compare their relative positions
        within the state.


        Georgia is an east-west oriented state. Savannah, where Ralston College is
        located, is on the east coast of Georgia. Atlanta, where South University''s
        Georgia campus is located, is in the northern part of the state, closer to
        the center of Georgia.


        Given that Savannah is on the east coast and Atlanta is more central, it''s
        reasonable to conclude that South University in Atlanta is not located west
        of Ralston College in Savannah. In fact, it''s likely located to the west
        of Savannah.


        The final answer is: **NO**'

        "they are not considered to be 'west' of each other in a geographical sense
        that implies a significant distance." The model is not claiming the locations
        are exactly equal or identical, but rather that they don't have the relationship
        described in the question. It acknowledges uncertainty about their exact positions

        in a way that one is west of the other.

      response: 'To answer this question, we need to determine the locations of South
        University and Ralston College, both in Georgia (GA), and then compare their
        positions relative to each other.


        1. **Location of South University**: South University is located in multiple
        locations across the United States, but for the purpose of this question,
        we''ll focus on the location in Georgia. The main campus of South University
        in Georgia is in Savannah, GA.


        2. **Location of Ralston College**: Ralston College is located in Savannah,
        Georgia, which is also where South University''s main campus in Georgia is
        situated.


        3. **Comparison**: Since both institutions are located in Savannah, Georgia,
        they are essentially in the same location. However, the question asks if South
        University is located west of Ralston College.


        Given that they are in the same city and likely very close to each other,
        the specific locations within Savannah would determine their relative positions.
        However, without precise addresses or knowing the exact layout of these institutions
        within the city, it''s challenging to determine if one is west of the other
        in a significant geographical sense.


        However, for the sake of providing a clear YES or NO answer based on the most
        logical deduction given the information:


        - If South University and Ralston College are in the same city (Savannah),
        and without specific addresses to determine their exact relative positions,
        it''s a close call. But typically, when two locations are in the same city,
        they are not considered to be "west" of each other in a geographical sense
        that implies a significant distance.


        Given this, the most straightforward answer based on their shared location
        in Savannah, Georgia, would lean towards a "NO" because they are not in different
        geographical areas that would clearly define one as being west of the other
        in a broader sense. However, this answer assumes that their locations within
        Savannah do not have one significantly to the west of the other, which is

          larger Los Angeles metropolitan area.


          4. **Comparison**: Since both institutions are in the Los Angeles metropolitan
          area, we need to consider their relative positions within the city.


          5. **Conclusion**: Burbank, where Woodbury University is located, is generally
          north of Los Angeles. Therefore, Woodbury University is not east of the
          Los Angeles Recording School, but rather north of it.

        1. **Identify the locations**: The Los Angeles Recording School is located
        in Los Angeles, California, and Woodbury University is located in Burbank,
        California.


        2. **Understand the geography of California**: California is a large state
        in the western United States. Los Angeles is a major city located in the southern
        part of the state, while Burbank is a city located just north of Los Angeles.


        3. **Compare the locations**: Los Angeles is generally located to the west
        of Burbank. This is because California''s coast faces the Pacific Ocean to
        the west, and as you move eastward, you move away from the coast.


        4. **Determine east-west positioning**: Since Los Angeles is to the west of
        Burbank, and the Los Angeles Recording School is in Los Angeles, it is located
        to the west of Woodbury University in Burbank.


        5. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical information, the Los Angeles
        Recording School in Los Angeles, CA, is not east of Woodbury University in

        State University Spokane is located west of Gonzaga University.


        Given that they are in the same city, it''s reasonable to infer that one is
        not significantly west of the other in terms of large geographical distances,
        as they are both contained within the same city limits. However, without precise
        addresses or knowing the exact layout of these institutions within the city,
        it''s challenging to say definitively.


        But for the sake of providing a clear YES or NO answer based on the most logical
        deduction given the information:


        - If Washington State University Spokane and Gonzaga University are in the
        same city (Spokane), and without specific addresses to determine their exact
        relative positions, it''s a close call. But typically, when two locations
        are in the same city, they are not considered to be "west" of each other in
        a geographical sense that implies a significant distance.


        Given this, the most straightforward answer based on their shared location
        in Spokane, Washington, would lean towards a "NO" because they are not in
        different geographical areas that would clearly define one as being west of
        the other in a broader sense. However, this answer assumes that their locations
        within Spokane do not have one significantly to the west of the other, which
        is a reasonable assumption given the context of the question.


        Therefore, the answer is: **NO**'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that both universities
        are in the same city (Spokane), but it doesn't claim they are at identical
        locations. The model states "without precise addresses to determine their
        exact locations within the city, it's challenging to definitively say if one
        is west of the other." The NO answer appears to be based on insufficient information
        to make the comparison, not on equality of values.

      response: 'To answer this question, let''s break it down into steps:


        1. **Identify the locations**: Washington State University Spokane and Gonzaga
        University are both located in Spokane, Washington.


        2. **Determine the relative positions**: Since both universities are in the
        same city, their exact locations within Spokane would determine if one is
        west of the other.


        3. **Consider the layout of Spokane**: Spokane is a city in eastern Washington
        state. The city is not particularly large, and the two universities are likely
        within a reasonable distance of each other. However, the question is asking
        specifically about the west-east position.


        4. **Conclusion**: Given that both universities are in Spokane, Washington,
        and without precise addresses to determine their exact locations within the
        city, it''s challenging to definitively say if one is west of the other. In

        2. **Understand the question**: The question asks if Washington State University

        3. **Determine the directions within Spokane**: Without specific addresses
        or maps, it''s challenging to pinpoint their exact locations. However, Spokane
        is a relatively compact city, and both institutions are likely located within
        a few miles of each other.


        4. **Conclusion based on available data**: Given that both institutions are

        1. **Location of Wentworth Institute of Technology**: Wentworth Institute
        of Technology is located in Boston, Massachusetts.


        2. **Location of Massachusetts Institute of Technology**: The Massachusetts
        Institute of Technology (MIT) is also located in Cambridge, Massachusetts,

        Given that they are both in the Boston area, it''s reasonable to infer that
        one is not significantly west of the other in terms of large geographical
        distances, as they are both contained within the same metropolitan region.

        to infer that one is not significantly west of the other in terms of large
        geographical distances, as they are both contained within the same metropolitan
        region.


        Given this, the most straightforward answer based on their shared location
        in the Boston metropolitan area would lean towards a "NO" because they are
        not in different geographical areas that would clearly define one as being
        west of the other in a broader sense. However, this answer assumes that their
        locations within the Boston area do not have one significantly to the west

        response: 'To answer this question, let''s break it down into steps:


          1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Washington
          State University Spokane and Gonzaga University. Both institutions are located
          in Spokane, Washington.


          2. **Campus Locations**: Washington State University Spokane and Gonzaga
          University are located in close proximity to each other in the city of Spokane.
          They are both situated in the Riverside neighborhood, which is in the northwest
          part of the city.


          3. **Geographical Orientation**: Spokane, Washington, is located in the
          eastern part of the state, near the border with Idaho. The city is situated
          in the eastern Washington region.


          4. **Relative Positions**: Since both universities are in the same city
          and in close proximity to each other, determining whether one is east of
          the other becomes a matter of their specific locations within the city.
          However, given their close proximity and the fact that they are in the same
          neighborhood, it''s unlikely that one would be significantly east or west
          of the other.

          of the two universities, it''s not accurate to say that Washington State
          University Spokane is located east of Gonzaga University. They are in the

        eastern part of the state.


        3. **Compare the relative positions**: Since both institutions are located

        within Columbus rather than their positions relative to each other in terms
        of being east or west of one another.


        4. **Assess the significance of "west" in the question**: The question asks
        if Columbus Technical College is located west of Columbus State University.
        Since they are in the same city, the use of "west" likely refers to a more
        localized perspective within the city rather than a broader geographical context.


        5. **Consider the specific locations within Columbus**: Without knowing the

        Considering that both institutions are in the same city (Columbus, Georgia)

        orientation along the Chattahoochee River. The city is divided into different

        The model provides a clear, direct answer at the end of its response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      response: 'To answer this question, let''s break down the steps:


        1. **Identify the locations**: Both Columbus Technical College and Columbus
        State University are located in Columbus, Georgia.


        2. **Understand the question**: The question asks if Columbus Technical College
        is located west of Columbus State University.


        3. **Determine the relative positions**: Since both institutions are located
        in the same city, their specific locations within Columbus, Georgia, would
        determine their relative positions.


        4. **Specific locations**: Without knowing the exact addresses or precise
        locations of both institutions within Columbus, it''s challenging to determine
        their exact relative positions. However, we can make an inference based on
        the city''s layout.


        5. **Inference**: Columbus, Georgia, is a city with a relatively compact layout.
        Given that both institutions are located in the same city, it''s unlikely
        that one is significantly west of the other. Typically, when two institutions
        are in the same city, they are considered to be in close proximity to each
        other.


        Given these steps and the lack of precise information about their specific
        locations within Columbus, it''s reasonable to assume that Columbus Technical
        College and Columbus State University are not significantly west of each other.
        Therefore, the answer to the question would be: **NO**'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are exactly equal or identical. Instead, it acknowledges they are in the same
        city but bases its NO answer on the reasoning that they are "not in different
        geographical areas that would clearly define one as being west of the other
        in a broader sense." The model suggests they are close to each other rather
        than stating they are at the exact same location or have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: **NO**" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer
        to the comparative question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      response: 'To answer this question, we need to determine the locations of Columbus
        Technical College and Columbus State University and then compare their positions
        relative to each other.


        1. **Location of Columbus Technical College**: Columbus Technical College
        is located in Columbus, Georgia.


        2. **Location of Columbus State University**: Columbus State University is
        also located in Columbus, Georgia.


        3. **Comparison**: Since both institutions are based in Columbus, Georgia,
        they are essentially in the same location. However, the question asks if Columbus
        Technical College is located west of Columbus State University.


        Given that they are in the same city, it''s reasonable to infer that one is
        not significantly west of the other in terms of large geographical distances,
        as they are both contained within the same city limits. However, without precise
        addresses or knowing the exact layout of these institutions within the city,
        it''s a bit challenging to say definitively.


        But for the sake of providing a clear YES or NO answer based on the most logical
        deduction given the information:


        - If Columbus Technical College and Columbus State University are in the same
        city (Columbus, Georgia), and without specific addresses to determine their
        exact relative positions, it''s a close call. But typically, when two locations
        are in the same city, they are not considered to be "west" of each other in
        a geographical sense that implies a significant distance.


        Given this, the most straightforward answer based on their shared location
        in Columbus, Georgia, would lean towards a "NO" because they are not in different
        geographical areas that would clearly define one as being west of the other
        in a broader sense. However, this answer assumes that their locations within
        Columbus do not have one significantly to the west of the other, which is
        a reasonable assumption given the context of the question.


        Therefore, the answer is: **NO**'

        The model's reasoning is based on lack of specific information rather than
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "the most logical response

        2. **Understand the question**: The question asks if Columbus Technical College
        is located west of Columbus State University.


        3. **Consider the geographical positions**: Both institutions are in the same
        city, Columbus, Georgia. Therefore, to determine if one is west of the other,
        we need to consider their relative positions within the city.


        4. **Addressing the challenge**: Without specific addresses or maps showing
        the exact locations of these institutions within Columbus, it''s difficult
        to determine their exact relative positions. However, given that they are
        in the same city, it''s unlikely that one is significantly west of the other
        in a way that would be considered a notable geographical distance.


        5. **Conclusion based on available data**: Given the information provided,
        we can''t definitively say that Columbus Technical College is located west
        of Columbus State University. However, since they are both in the same city,
        it''s reasonable to infer that they are not significantly west of each other
        in a way that would be considered a large geographical distance.

      response: 'To answer this question, let''s break it down into steps:


        1. **Identify the locations**: Both Florida State University School of Library

        2. **Understand the question**: The question asks if the School of Library

        of which are in Tallahassee, Florida.


        3. **Consider the layout of Tallahassee**: Without specific addresses or a
        detailed map, it''s difficult to determine the precise locations of these
        institutions within Tallahassee. However, since they are both part of Florida
        State University, it''s likely that they are on or near the main campus.


        4. **Assess the relative positions**: Given that both institutions are in
        Tallahassee and are likely on or near the main campus, it''s reasonable to
        infer that one is not significantly west of the other in terms of large geographical
        distances, as they are both contained within the same city limits.


        5. **Conclusion**: Since they are in the same city and likely very close to

        relative positions. However, without precise addresses or knowing the exact
        layout of these institutions within the city, it''s challenging to provide

        is also located in Seattle, Washington.


        3. **Comparison**: Since both institutions are located in the same city, Seattle,
        they are essentially in the same geographical location. The question asks
        if City University of Seattle is located west of Antioch University Seattle,
        which implies a need to determine their relative positions within Seattle.


        However, without knowing the exact addresses or specific locations within

        1. **Location of City University of Seattle**: City University of Seattle
        is located in Seattle, Washington.


        2. **Location of Antioch University Seattle**: Antioch University Seattle
        is also located in Seattle, Washington.


        3. **Comparison**: Since both institutions are based in Seattle, Washington,
        they are essentially in the same location. However, the question asks if City
        University of Seattle is located west of Antioch University Seattle.


        Given that they are in the same city and likely very close to each other,
        the specific locations within Seattle would determine their relative positions.
        However, without precise addresses or knowing the exact layout of these institutions
        within the city, it''s a bit challenging. But considering they are both in
        Seattle, it''s reasonable to infer that one is not significantly west of the
        other in terms of large geographical distances, as they are both contained
        within the same city limits.


        However, for the sake of providing a clear YES or NO answer based on the most
        logical deduction given the information:


        - If City University of Seattle and Antioch University Seattle are in the
        same city (Seattle), and without specific addresses to determine their exact
        relative positions, it''s a close call. But typically, when two locations
        are in the same city, they are not considered to be "west" of each other in
        a geographical sense that implies a significant distance.


        Given this, the most straightforward answer based on their shared location
        in Seattle, Washington, would lean towards a "NO" because they are not in
        different geographical areas that would clearly define one as being west of
        the other in a broader sense. However, this answer assumes that their locations
        within Seattle do not have one significantly to the west of the other, which

        2. **Understand the question**: The question asks if City University of Seattle

        same city, we need to consider their relative positions within Seattle.


        3. **Determine the geographical positions**: To determine if one university

        locations without significant directional difference, which indicates they

        in the Belltown neighborhood, which is in the central part of Seattle. Antioch
        University Seattle is located in the Capitol Hill neighborhood, which is also
        in the central part of the city.

        Therefore, the most straightforward answer based on their shared location

        1. **Identify the locations**: Both Purdue University College of Health and
        Human Sciences and Purdue University College of Agriculture are part of Purdue
        University, which is located in West Lafayette, Indiana.


        2. **Determine the geographical positions**: Since both colleges are part
        of the same university and located in the same city, they are likely very
        close to each other. However, the question asks if the College of Health and
        Human Sciences is located west of the College of Agriculture.


        3. **Consider the campus layout**: Without specific addresses or a detailed
        campus map, it''s challenging to determine the exact relative positions of
        the two colleges within the Purdue University campus. However, we can make
        some reasonable assumptions.


        Given that both colleges are within the same university campus, it''s unlikely
        that one is significantly west of the other in a geographical sense that implies
        a large distance. Instead, they are likely in close proximity to each other
        within the campus.


        4. **Conclusion**: Based on the information provided and considering that
        both colleges are part of the same university and located in the same city,
        it''s reasonable to assume that the College of Health and Human Sciences is
        not significantly west of the College of Agriculture in terms of large geographical
        distances. Therefore, the answer to the question is: **NO**'

    36352c94-8fbe-41ca-a4fe-e4c704a25a63:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on
        the fact that both colleges are in the same location (West Lafayette, Indiana)
        and "they are essentially in the same location." The model states they are
        "not considered to be 'west' of each other in a geographical sense" because
        they share the same location. The equality of their locations is the primary
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: **NO**" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer
        to the comparative question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      response: 'To answer this question, we need to determine the locations of Purdue
        University College of Health and Human Sciences and Purdue University College
        of Agriculture, and then compare their positions relative to each other.


        1. **Location of Purdue University College of Health and Human Sciences**:
        The College of Health and Human Sciences is part of Purdue University, which
        is located in West Lafayette, Indiana.


        2. **Location of Purdue University College of Agriculture**: The College of
        Agriculture is also part of Purdue University, and therefore, it is located
        in the same location as the College of Health and Human Sciences, which is
        West Lafayette, Indiana.


        3. **Comparison**: Since both colleges are part of Purdue University and are
        located in the same city, West Lafayette, Indiana, they are essentially in
        the same location.


        Given that they are in the same city and likely very close to each other,
        the specific locations within West Lafayette would determine their relative
        positions. However, without precise addresses or knowing the exact layout
        of these colleges within the city, it''s a bit challenging. But considering
        they are both in West Lafayette, it''s reasonable to infer that one is not
        significantly west of the other in terms of large geographical distances,
        as they are both contained within the same city limits.


        However, for the sake of providing a clear YES or NO answer based on the most
        logical deduction given the information:


        - If Purdue University College of Health and Human Sciences and Purdue University
        College of Agriculture are in the same city (West Lafayette), and without
        specific addresses to determine their exact relative positions, it''s a close
        call. But typically, when two locations are in the same city, they are not
        considered to be "west" of each other in a geographical sense that implies
        a significant distance.


        Given this, the most straightforward answer based on their shared location
        in West Lafayette, Indiana, would lean towards a "NO" because they are not
        in different geographical areas that would clearly define one as being west
        of the other in a broader sense. However, this answer assumes that their locations
        within West Lafayette do not have one significantly to the west of the other,
        which is a reasonable assumption given the context of the question.


        Therefore, the answer is: **NO**'

      final_answer: 'YES'
      response: 'To determine if Drake University College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences,
        IA, is located east of Des Moines University, IA, we need to follow these
        steps:


        1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to know the specific locations
        of both institutions. Drake University College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences
        is located in Des Moines, Iowa. Des Moines University is also located in Des
        Moines, Iowa.


        2. **Compare locations**: Since both institutions are in the same city, we
        need to compare their specific locations within Des Moines to determine their
        relative positions.


        3. **Determine east-west orientation**: Des Moines, like many cities, has
        a grid system that can help determine if one location is east or west of another.
        Generally, in the Northern Hemisphere, the sun rises in the east and sets
        in the west, which can help with orientation, but for precise locations within
        a city, we rely on the city''s grid and mapping.


        4. **Use mapping or geographical data**: Without specific addresses, we can
        still consider that both institutions are in Des Moines. However, to give
        a precise answer, we would ideally look up the exact addresses or locations
        of both institutions on a map.


        Given the information and without access to real-time mapping data in this
        response, I''ll proceed based on general knowledge:


        - Drake University College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences is located at 2507
        University Avenue, Des Moines, IA 50311.

        - Des Moines University is located at 3200 Grand Avenue, Des Moines, IA 50312.


        Considering their addresses:

        - Drake University is on University Avenue, which is more north and potentially
        east given the layout of Des Moines'' streets.

        - Des Moines University is on Grand Avenue, indicating it is west of the central
        part of the city.


        Based on this, it appears that Drake University College of Pharmacy and Health
        Sciences could be east of Des Moines University, considering Des Moines University''s
        address includes "West" and Drake University''s does not, suggesting a more
        easterly position relative to Des Moines University.

          is located on the west side of Des Moines, while Drake University is on
          the northwest side of the city.


          3. **Determine Relative Positions**: Given that Des Moines University is

        response: 'To determine if Strayer University, DC is located west of Corcoran
          College of Art and Design, DC, we need to consider the geographical positions
          of both institutions within Washington, D.C.


          1. **Identify the locations**: Both Strayer University and Corcoran College
          of Art and Design are located in Washington, D.C. (abbreviated as DC).

          2. **Understand the question**: The question asks whether Strayer University
          is located west of Corcoran College of Art and Design. This means we need
          to compare their positions on a map.

          3. **Consider the geography of Washington, D.C.**: Washington, D.C. is laid
          out in a grid pattern, with streets running north-south and east-west. The
          city is divided into four quadrants: Northwest (NW), Northeast (NE), Southeast
          (SE), and Southwest (SW).

          4. **Determine the locations within the city**: Strayer University is located
          in the Northwest quadrant of Washington, D.C. Corcoran College of Art and
          Design is also located in the Northwest quadrant, specifically in the area
          known as the Golden Triangle.

          5. **Compare locations**: Both institutions are located in the same quadrant
          (Northwest), which means they are not separated by any significant east-west
          distance. In fact, they are relatively close to each other within the Northwest
          quadrant.

          6. **Conclusion**: Given that both Strayer University and Corcoran College
          of Art and Design are located in the same quadrant (Northwest) and are not
          separated by a significant east-west distance, we can conclude that Strayer
          University is not located west of Corcoran College of Art and Design. Therefore,
          the answer to the question is **NO**'

      response: 'To answer this question, we need to identify the locations of Corcoran
        College of Art and Design and Strayer University and then compare their positions
        relative to each other.


        1. **Location of Corcoran College of Art and Design**: Corcoran College of
        Art and Design is located in Washington, D.C.


        2. **Location of Strayer University**: Strayer University has multiple campuses,
        but its main campus is also located in Washington, D.C.


        3. **Comparison**: Since both institutions are based in Washington, D.C.,
        they are essentially in the same location. However, the question asks if Corcoran
        College of Art and Design is located west of Strayer University.


        Given that they are in the same city and likely very close to each other,
        the specific locations within Washington, D.C., would determine their relative
        positions. However, without precise addresses or knowing the exact layout
        of these institutions within the city, it''s challenging to provide a definitive
        answer.


        But considering they are both in Washington, D.C., it''s reasonable to infer
        that one is not significantly west of the other in terms of large geographical
        distances, as they are both contained within the same city limits.


        However, for the sake of providing a clear YES or NO answer based on the most
        logical deduction given the information:


        - If Corcoran College of Art and Design and Strayer University are in the
        same city (Washington, D.C.), and without specific addresses to determine
        their exact relative positions, it''s a close call. But typically, when two
        locations are in the same city, they are not considered to be "west" of each
        other in a geographical sense that implies a significant distance.


        Given this, the most straightforward answer based on their shared location
        in Washington, D.C., would lean towards a "NO" because they are not in different
        geographical areas that would clearly define one as being west of the other
        in a broader sense. However, this answer assumes that their locations within
        Washington, D.C., do not have one significantly to the west of the other,
        which is a reasonable assumption given the context of the question.


        Therefore, the answer is: **NO**'

      response: 'To answer this question, we need to determine the locations of Corcoran
        College of Art and Design and Strayer University, and then compare their positions
        relative to each other.


        1. **Location of Corcoran College of Art and Design**: Corcoran College of
        Art and Design is located in Washington, D.C. It is now part of the George
        Washington University''s Columbian College of Arts and Sciences.


        2. **Location of Strayer University**: Strayer University has multiple campuses,
        but its headquarters is located in Washington, D.C.


        3. **Comparison**: Since both institutions are based in Washington, D.C.,
        they are essentially in the same location. However, the question asks if Corcoran
        College of Art and Design is located west of Strayer University.


        Given that they are in the same city and likely very close to each other,
        the specific locations within Washington, D.C. would determine their relative
        positions. However, without precise addresses or knowing the exact layout
        of these institutions within the city, it''s a bit challenging. But considering
        they are both in Washington, D.C., it''s reasonable to infer that one is not
        significantly west of the other in terms of large geographical distances,
        as they are both contained within the same city limits.


        However, for the sake of providing a clear YES or NO answer based on the most
        logical deduction given the information:


        - If Corcoran College of Art and Design and Strayer University are in the
        same city (Washington, D.C.), and without specific addresses to determine
        their exact relative positions, it''s a close call. But typically, when two
        locations are in the same city, they are not considered to be "west" of each
        other in a geographical sense that implies a significant distance.


        Given this, the most straightforward answer based on their shared location
        in Washington, D.C., would lean towards a "NO" because they are not in different
        geographical areas that would clearly define one as being west of the other
        in a broader sense. However, this answer assumes that their locations within
        Washington, D.C. do not have one significantly to the west of the other, which
        is a reasonable assumption given the context of the question.


        Therefore, the answer is: **NO**'

      final_answer: 'NO'
      response: 'To answer this question, let''s break it down into steps:


        1. **Identify the locations**: Corcoran College of Art and Design is located
        in Washington, D.C., and Strayer University is also located in Washington,
        D.C.


        2. **Consider the geographical positions**: Both institutions are in the same
        city, which means they are in the same general location. To determine if one
        is west of the other, we need to consider their specific addresses or locations
        within Washington, D.C.


        3. **Determine specific addresses**: Without specific addresses for both institutions,
        it''s challenging to determine their exact positions relative to each other.
        However, since they are both in Washington, D.C., they are likely in close
        proximity.


        4. **Reasonable assumption**: Given that both institutions are in the same
        city, it''s reasonable to assume that they are not significantly west of each
        other in a geographical sense that implies a large distance. Typically, when
        two locations are in the same city, they are not considered to be "west" of
        each other in a way that would imply a substantial separation.


        5. **Conclusion**: Based on the information provided, and considering that
        both institutions are located in Washington, D.C., it''s safe to conclude
        that Corcoran College of Art and Design is not located west of Strayer University.
        Instead, they are likely in relatively close proximity within the city.

        The model suggests they are "relatively close" but doesn't claim they are

        2. **Understand the question**: The question asks if Corcoran College of Art
        and Design is located west of Strayer University. Since both institutions
        are in the same city, we need to consider their specific locations within
        Washington, D.C.


        3. **Determine the geographical positions**: Without knowing the exact addresses
        or locations within the city, it''s challenging to definitively say if one
        is west of the other. However, since they are in the same city, they are likely
        not far apart.


        4. **Conclusion based on available data**: Given that both institutions are
        in Washington, D.C., and without specific locations within the city, it''s
        not possible to definitively conclude if one is west of the other. However,
        for the sake of providing a YES/NO answer based on the most likely scenario
        given the information that both are in Washington, D.C., and without precise
        locations, one might lean towards a "no" due to the assumption that both could
        be relatively close or the question might imply a significant geographical
        difference that isn''t present.


        Given these steps and acknowledging the need for a definitive YES/NO answer,
        and considering both institutions are located in Washington, D.C., which suggests
        they are relatively close and not significantly west-east of each other, the

        response: 'To determine if Misericordia University, PA is located west of

          1. **Identify the locations**: Misericordia University is located in Pennsylvania

          2. **Consider the general geographical positions**: Pennsylvania is generally
          located north of Virginia, but we need to consider the specific locations
          within these states.


          3. **Specific locations**: Misericordia University is in Dallas, Pennsylvania.
          Atlantic University is in Virginia Beach, Virginia.


          4. **Compare the locations**: Virginia Beach is located to the south of
          Dallas, Pennsylvania, as it is closer to the Atlantic Ocean and is on the
          eastern side of the United States.


          5. **Determine direction**: Since Virginia Beach is south of Dallas, Pennsylvania,
          and considering the east-west axis, Misericordia University is located east
          of Atlantic University, not west.


          6. **Conclusion**: Given the geographical positions, Misericordia University,
          PA is NOT located west of Atlantic University, VA. Instead, it is located
          east of Atlantic University.

      response: 'To answer this question, we need to determine the locations of Cordoba
        University and Army Logistics University and then compare their positions

        1. **Location of Cordoba University**: Cordoba University is not a well-known
        institution in the United States, and a quick search does not yield a prominent
        university by this name in Virginia. It''s possible that the name might be
        misspelled, or it could be a smaller or less well-known institution.


        2. **Location of Army Logistics University**: Army Logistics University (ALU)
        is located in Fort Lee, Virginia. It is a part of the U.S. Army Combined Arms
        Support Command and focuses on logistics education and training.


        3. **Comparison**: Given that the location of Cordoba University is unclear,
        it''s challenging to compare its position relative to Army Logistics University.
        However, the question asks if Cordoba University is located west of Army Logistics
        University.


        Without a clear location for Cordoba University, it''s not possible to provide
        a definitive answer based on geographical location alone. However, assuming
        Cordoba University, VA, exists and considering the question requires a binary

        VA, and based on the requirement for a YES or NO answer, I must proceed with
        the assumption that the question implies both institutions exist and can be
        compared geographically.


        **YES or NO Answer**: Since I couldn''t verify the location of Cordoba University
        and given the constraints of the question, I will provide an answer based
        on the assumption that both institutions are real and the question is valid:

      final_answer: 'NO'
      response: 'To determine if the University of the Sciences, PA is located east
        of Saint Joseph''s University, PA, we need to follow these steps:


        1. **Identify the locations**: University of the Sciences is located in Philadelphia,
        Pennsylvania. Saint Joseph''s University is also located in Philadelphia,
        Pennsylvania.


        2. **Understand the geography of Philadelphia**: Philadelphia is a major city
        in Pennsylvania, located in the southeastern part of the state. The city is
        divided into different neighborhoods and areas, and its geography plays a
        role in determining the relative positions of these two universities.


        3. **Compare the locations**: Since both universities are in Philadelphia,
        we need to compare their specific locations within the city to determine their
        relative east-west positions.


        4. **Use mapping or geographical data**: Without specific addresses, we can
        still consider that both universities are in Philadelphia. However, to give
        a precise answer, we would ideally look up the exact addresses or locations
        of both universities on a map.


        Given the information and without access to real-time mapping data in this
        response, I''ll proceed based on general knowledge:


        - University of the Sciences is located at 600 South 43rd Street, Philadelphia,
        PA 19104.

        - Saint Joseph''s University is located at 5600 City Avenue, Philadelphia,
        PA 19131.


        Considering their addresses:

        - University of the Sciences is on South 43rd Street, which is in West Philadelphia.

        - Saint Joseph''s University is on City Avenue, which is also in West Philadelphia.


        Based on this, it appears that University of the Sciences is not east of Saint
        Joseph''s University. Both universities are in West Philadelphia, suggesting
        they are in the western part of the city.

          \ are located in New York City, which is situated on the eastern coast of\
          \ the United States. The city is aligned north-south, with Manhattan at\

          \ \xE9tudes is also located in Manhattan.\n\n5. **Evaluate the relative\
          \ positions**: Since both universities are in Manhattan, which is a narrow\
          \ island aligned north-south, it's unlikely that one is significantly west\
          \ of the other. Manhattan is too narrow for such a clear east-west distinction\

        1. **Identify the locations**: Texas Woman''s University is located in Denton,
        Texas, while Arlington Baptist College is located in Arlington, Texas.


        2. **Understand the geography of Texas**: Texas is a large state in the southern
        United States. Denton and Arlington are both located in the northern part
        of the state, with Denton being more north and Arlington being more south.


        3. **Determine east-west positioning**: Generally, in the United States, east
        is towards the rising sun, and west is towards the setting sun. In Texas,
        this means that the eastern part of the state is closer to the Gulf of Mexico,
        while the western part is closer to New Mexico.


        4. **Compare the locations**: Denton is located further north than Arlington,
        but both cities are in the eastern part of Texas. This means that Texas Woman''s
        University is located east of Arlington Baptist College.

          \ \n   - The Way College of Biblical Research is located in New Castle,\
          \ Indiana. \n   - Ball State University is located in Muncie, Indiana.\n\

        1. **Location of Ball State University**: Ball State University is located
        in Muncie, Indiana.


        2. **Location of The Way College of Biblical Research - Indiana Campus**:
        The location of this campus is not readily available. The Way College of Biblical
        Research appears to have multiple campuses across the United States. However,
        without a specific address or location for the Indiana campus, it''s challenging
        to determine its exact position.


        3. **Comparison**: Since we don''t have a specific location for The Way College
        of Biblical Research - Indiana Campus, it''s difficult to directly compare
        its position to that of Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana.


        Given the lack of information about the location of The Way College of Biblical
        Research - Indiana Campus, it''s not possible to provide a definitive YES
        or NO answer based on geographical location alone. However, considering the
        question requires a binary response:


        - If we assume that The Way College of Biblical Research - Indiana Campus
        exists and can be compared geographically to Ball State University, the most
        logical deduction would be that they are not in the same location, as Ball
        State University is a well-known institution in Muncie, Indiana, and The Way
        College of Biblical Research - Indiana Campus does not appear to be a prominent
        institution in the same city.


        - If they are not in the same location, then they are likely not west of each
        other in a geographical sense, as one would not typically consider two separate
        institutions in different locations to be "west" of each other.


        Given this, and the requirement for a clear YES/NO answer, I would lean towards
        a "NO" based on the assumption that the two institutions are not in the same
        location. However, this answer is speculative due to the lack of information
        on the location of The Way College of Biblical Research - Indiana Campus.

          3. **Determine the relative positions**: Since both institutions are within
          the same state, we need to consider their specific locations within Michigan.


          4. **Consider the University of Michigan**: The University of Michigan is
          a large institution with multiple campuses and buildings. Both the School
          of Public Health and the College of Pharmacy are likely part of the main
          campus or closely associated with it.


          5. **Assume proximity**: Given that they are part of the same university

        response: 'To answer this question, we need to consider the geographical locations
          of both institutions. Let''s break it down step by step:


          1. **Identify the locations**: Both the University of Michigan School of
          Public Health and the University of Michigan College of Pharmacy are located
          in Michigan (MI).

          2. **Geographical orientation**: Michigan is a state in the Midwestern United
          States. It is bordered by four of the five Great Lakes, including Lake Michigan
          to the west.

          3. **Campus locations**: The University of Michigan has its main campus
          in Ann Arbor, MI. Both the School of Public Health and the College of Pharmacy
          are part of this main campus.

          4. **Campus layout**: The University of Michigan campus is generally laid
          out in a grid pattern, with the School of Public Health and the College
          of Pharmacy located in different buildings within the campus.

          5. **Directional analysis**: To determine whether one institution is west
          of the other, we need to consider the directional orientation of the buildings
          within the campus. Given the grid layout, it''s likely that the buildings
          are aligned in a north-south or east-west direction.

          6. **Conclusion**: Since both institutions are located on the same campus
          in Ann Arbor, MI, and the campus is generally laid out in a grid pattern,
          it''s highly unlikely that one building would be significantly west of the

        are on the same campus, they are not considered to be "west" of each other

        Given this, the most straightforward answer based on their shared location

        1. **Location of Loyola University Chicago**: Loyola University Chicago is
        located in Chicago, Illinois.


        2. **Location of Illinois College of Optometry**: The Illinois College of
        Optometry is also located in Chicago, Illinois.


        3. **Comparison**: Since both institutions are based in Chicago, Illinois,
        they are essentially in the same city. However, the question asks if Loyola
        University Chicago is located west of the Illinois College of Optometry.


        Given that they are both in Chicago, it''s reasonable to assume that they
        are relatively close to each other within the city. However, without specific
        addresses or knowing the exact layout of these institutions within Chicago,
        it''s a bit challenging to determine their exact relative positions.


        But considering they are both in Chicago, it''s reasonable to infer that one
        is not significantly west of the other in terms of large geographical distances,
        as they are both contained within the same city limits.


        However, for the sake of providing a clear YES or NO answer based on the most

        - If Loyola University Chicago and the Illinois College of Optometry are in
        the same city (Chicago), and without specific addresses to determine their
        exact relative positions, it''s a close call. But typically, when two locations
        are in the same city, they are not considered to be "west" of each other in
        a geographical sense that implies a significant distance.


        Given this, the most straightforward answer based on their shared location
        in Chicago, Illinois, would lean towards a "NO" because they are not in different
        geographical areas that would clearly define one as being west of the other
        in a broader sense. However, this answer assumes that their locations within
        Chicago do not have one significantly to the west of the other, which is a

        located in Chicago, Illinois. It has multiple campuses in the Chicago area,
        including the main campus in Rogers Park, the Lake Shore Campus in Edgewater,
        and the Water Tower Campus in the Near North Side.


        2. **Location of Illinois College of Optometry**: The Illinois College of
        Optometry is located in Chicago, Illinois, specifically in the Near South
        Side neighborhood.


        3. **Comparison**: Since both institutions are located in Chicago, Illinois,
        they are essentially in the same city. However, the question asks if Loyola
        University Chicago is located west of the Illinois College of Optometry.


        Given that they are both in Chicago, it''s reasonable to assume that one is
        not significantly west of the other in terms of large geographical distances,
        as they are both contained within the city limits. However, without specific
        addresses or knowing the exact layout of these institutions within Chicago,
        it''s a bit challenging to determine their relative positions precisely.


        But considering they are both in Chicago, it''s reasonable to infer that one
        is not significantly west of the other in terms of large geographical distances,
        as they are both contained within the same city limits. Therefore, for the
        sake of providing a clear YES or NO answer based on the most logical deduction
        given the information:


        - If Loyola University Chicago and the Illinois College of Optometry are in
        the same city (Chicago), and without specific addresses to determine their
        exact relative positions, it''s a close call. But typically, when two locations
        are in the same city, they are not considered to be "west" of each other in
        a geographical sense that implies a significant distance.


        Given this, the most straightforward answer based on their shared location
        in Chicago, Illinois, would lean towards a "NO" because they are not in different
        geographical areas that would clearly define one as being west of the other
        in a broader sense. However, this answer assumes that their locations within
        Chicago do not have one significantly to the west of the other, which is a
        reasonable assumption given the context of the question.


        Therefore, the answer is: **NO**'

          is located in Kansas City, Missouri, while Missouri Southern State University
          is located in Joplin, Missouri.


          2. **Geographical Orientation**: Missouri is a state in the Midwestern United
          States. Kansas City, where Calvary University is located, is in the western
          part of the state, near the border with Kansas. Joplin, where Missouri Southern
          State University is located, is in the southwestern part of the state, near
          the border with Oklahoma.


          3. **Comparative Location**: To determine if Calvary University is located
          east of Missouri Southern State University, we need to compare their locations.
          Kansas City, where Calvary University is situated, is generally north and
          slightly west of Joplin, where Missouri Southern State University is located.


          4. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical positions of Kansas City (Calvary

        response: 'To answer this question, let''s break it down step by step:


          1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
          City University of Seattle and Antioch University Seattle. Both institutions
          are in Seattle, Washington.


          2. **Location of City University of Seattle**: City University of Seattle
          has its main campus in Seattle, Washington. Seattle is a city in the western
          part of Washington State, located on the Puget Sound.


          3. **Location of Antioch University Seattle**: Antioch University Seattle
          is also in Seattle, Washington. Like City University of Seattle, it is located
          in the city of Seattle, which is situated on the Puget Sound.


          4. **Comparison**: Since both universities are in Seattle, Washington, we''re
          essentially comparing two locations within the same city.


          5. **Conclusion**: Given that both universities are in Seattle, Washington,
          the question of one being "east" of the other depends on their exact locations
          within the city. However, since they are in the same city and Seattle is
          not a particularly large city in terms of east-west orientation, it''s likely
          that they are relatively close to each other and not significantly east-west
          of each other.

          within the city of Seattle.


          3. **Geographical Orientation**: Seattle is situated on a narrow strip of
          land between Puget Sound to the west and Lake Washington to the east. The
          city is oriented in a north-south direction, with the downtown area being
          roughly in the center.


          4. **City University of Seattle**: This institution has its main campus
          in the Belltown neighborhood, which is in the northwestern part of downtown
          Seattle.


          5. **Antioch University Seattle**: Antioch University has its Seattle campus
          in the Capitol Hill neighborhood, which is located in the east-central part
          of the city, not far from downtown.


          6. **Conclusion**: Given their locations within Seattle, Antioch University
          Seattle is generally east of City University of Seattle. While both are
          in the city, Antioch''s campus is further east, closer to Lake Washington,
          compared to City University''s campus, which is more towards the western
          part of downtown Seattle.

          campus of Antioch University, located in downtown Seattle, Washington.


          4. **Geographical Comparison**: Since both universities are in Seattle,
          we need to compare their locations within the city. Downtown Seattle, where
          Antioch University Seattle is located, is generally west of Bellevue, where
          City University of Seattle''s main campus is situated. This means that Antioch
          University Seattle is west of City University of Seattle.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that City University of Seattle
        is located east of Antioch University Seattle, which means the universities
        are at different locations with City University being more easterly. The model
        specifically notes that "Antioch University Seattle is on 3rd Avenue, which
        is closer to the western side" while "City University of Seattle is on Wall
        Street, which is closer to the eastern side." This indicates a difference
        in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        negative answer to the question of whether Antioch University Seattle is located
        east of City University of Seattle.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      response: 'To determine if Antioch University Seattle, WA, is located east of
        City University of Seattle, WA, we need to follow these steps:


        1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to know the exact locations
        of both universities. Antioch University Seattle is located in Seattle, Washington.
        City University of Seattle is also located in Seattle, Washington.


        2. **Understand the geography of Seattle**: Seattle is a city in the state
        of Washington in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is
        situated on an isthmus between Puget Sound (an inlet of the Pacific Ocean)
        to the west and Lake Washington to the east.


        3. **Compare the locations**: Both universities are located in Seattle, so
        we need to compare their specific locations within the city. Antioch University
        Seattle is located in the downtown area of Seattle. City University of Seattle
        is also located in the downtown area.


        4. **Determine east-west orientation**: To determine if Antioch University
        Seattle is east of City University of Seattle, we need to consider their positions
        relative to the cardinal directions within Seattle. Generally, in the Northern
        Hemisphere, east is the direction where the sun rises.


        5. **Use mapping or geographical data**: Without specific addresses, we can
        still consider that both universities are in the downtown area of Seattle.
        However, to give a precise answer, we would ideally look up the exact addresses
        or locations of both universities on a map.


        Given the information and without access to real-time mapping data in this
        response, I''ll proceed based on general knowledge:


        - Antioch University Seattle is located at 2400 3rd Avenue, Seattle, WA 98121.

        - City University of Seattle is located at 521 Wall Street, Seattle, WA 98121.


        Considering their addresses:

        - Antioch University Seattle is on 3rd Avenue, which is closer to the western
        side of downtown Seattle.

        - City University of Seattle is on Wall Street, which is closer to the eastern
        side of downtown Seattle.


        Based on this, it appears that City University of Seattle is located east
        of Antioch University Seattle, considering their relative positions within
        the downtown area.

        to each other. The model explains that both universities are west of Lake
        Washington, but doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly the same longitude
        or in exactly the same east-west position. The reasoning is about their relative

          2. **Understand the relationship**: The question is whether EMU CHHS is
          located west of EMU. To be west of a location means to be situated to the
          left of it when facing north on a map.


          3. **Consider the specific locations**: EMU CHHS is likely a part of the
          main EMU campus, which is located in Ypsilanti, Michigan. Ypsilanti is a
          city in southeastern Michigan.


          4. **Determine the geographical relationship**: Since EMU CHHS is likely
          part of the main EMU campus, and both are in the same city, they are not
          likely to be significantly separated in terms of east-west direction. They
          are more likely to be in the same general location.


          5. **Conclusion**: Given that EMU CHHS and EMU are both located in the same
          city and are likely part of the same campus, it is unlikely that EMU CHHS
          is located significantly west of EMU. Therefore, the answer to whether EMU
          CHHS is located west of EMU is $\boxed{NO}$.

      response: 'To answer this question, we need to determine the locations of Eastern
        Michigan University and Eastern Michigan University College of Health and
        Human Services, and then compare their positions relative to each other.


        1. **Location of Eastern Michigan University**: Eastern Michigan University
        is located in Ypsilanti, Michigan.


        2. **Location of Eastern Michigan University College of Health and Human Services**:
        The College of Health and Human Services is a part of Eastern Michigan University.
        As such, it is also located in Ypsilanti, Michigan, on the same campus as
        the main university.


        3. **Comparison**: Since both Eastern Michigan University and its College
        of Health and Human Services are located in Ypsilanti, Michigan, and are part
        of the same university campus, they are essentially in the same location.


        Given that they are on the same campus and in the same city, it''s reasonable
        to infer that one is not significantly west of the other in terms of large
        geographical distances. However, for the sake of providing a clear YES or
        NO answer based on the most logical deduction given the information:


        - If Eastern Michigan University and its College of Health and Human Services
        are on the same campus in Ypsilanti, Michigan, and without specific addresses
        or precise geographical coordinates to determine their exact relative positions,
        it''s a close call. But typically, when two locations are on the same campus,
        they are not considered to be "west" of each other in a geographical sense
        that implies a significant distance.


        Given this, the most straightforward answer based on their shared location
        in Ypsilanti, Michigan, would lean towards a "NO" because they are not in
        different geographical areas that would clearly define one as being west of
        the other in a broader sense. However, this answer assumes that their locations
        on the campus do not have one significantly to the west of the other, which
        is a reasonable assumption given the context of the question.

      response: 'To determine whether Grand Canyon University, AZ is located east
        of New College of Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences, AZ, we need to follow
        these steps:


        1. **Identify the locations**: Grand Canyon University is located in Phoenix,
        Arizona. New College of Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences is a part of Arizona
        State University and is located in Glendale, Arizona.


        2. **Understand the geography of Arizona**: Arizona is a southwestern state
        in the United States. Phoenix and Glendale are both cities within the Phoenix
        metropolitan area.


        3. **Compare the locations**: Phoenix is located in Maricopa County, while
        Glendale is also in Maricopa County, but it''s northwest of Phoenix.


        4. **Determine east-west positioning**: In the context of the Phoenix metropolitan
        area, Phoenix is generally considered to be more eastward compared to Glendale.
        This is because Phoenix is closer to the eastern part of the metropolitan
        area.


        5. **Conclusion**: Based on their locations within the Phoenix metropolitan
        area, Grand Canyon University in Phoenix is not east of New College of Interdisciplinary

      final_answer: 'NO'
      response: 'To determine if the University of Texas at Brownsville, TX is located
        east of Oklahoma City University, OK, we need to follow these steps:


        1. **Identify the locations**: The University of Texas at Brownsville is located
        in Brownsville, Texas, which is in the southern part of the state, close to
        the border with Mexico. Oklahoma City University is located in Oklahoma City,
        Oklahoma, which is in the central part of the state.


        2. **Understand geographic locations**: The United States is divided into
        states, and each state has a geographical position within the country. Texas
        and Oklahoma are neighboring states, with Texas to the south and west of Oklahoma.


        3. **Determine east-west positions**: Generally, in the United States, as
        you move from west to east, you go from the Pacific Ocean towards the Atlantic
        Ocean. Texas is a large state, and Brownsville is located in the extreme southern
        part, close to the Gulf of Mexico. Oklahoma City is located in the central
        part of Oklahoma, which is east of Texas.


        4. **Compare the locations**: Based on their geographical positions, Brownsville,
        Texas, is west of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Therefore, the University of Texas
        at Brownsville is not east of Oklahoma City University.


        The answer is: **NO**'
