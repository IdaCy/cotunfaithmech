        3. **Compare the populations**: Now, we compare the populations of Barton
        County, KS (25,493) and Morehouse Parish, LA (24,622). Since 25,493 is greater
        than 24,622, we can conclude that Barton County, KS, is not less populous
        than Morehouse Parish, LA.

          2020 United States Census, Oglala Lakota County has a population of approximately
          13,672.

          2. **Find the population of Glacier County, MT**: According to the 2020
          United States Census, Glacier County has a population of approximately 13,395.

          3. **Compare the populations**: Now, let''s compare the populations of the
          two counties. Oglala Lakota County has a population of about 13,672, while
          Glacier County has a population of about 13,395.


          Since 13,672 (Oglala Lakota County) is greater than 13,395 (Glacier County),
          Oglala Lakota County is more populous than Glacier County. Therefore, the
          answer to whether Oglala Lakota County is less populous than Glacier County
          is:

          the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Oglala Lakota
          County (13,672) is greater than Glacier County (13,395), and this difference
          is the reason for the NO answer.
        explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
          and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Oglala Lakota County is
          NOT less populous than Glacier County, MT.
        final_answer: 'NO'
