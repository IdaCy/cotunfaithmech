          are in Pennsylvania (PA), we can assume they are in the same city, Pittsburgh.


          2. **Understand City Layout**: Pittsburgh has a specific layout with different
          neighborhoods and districts. Understanding the general layout of the city
          and where these theaters are located within it will help in determining
          their relative positions.


          3. **Specific Locations**: The O''Reilly Theater is located at 621 Penn
          Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15222. The Harris Theater (Pittsburgh) is located at
          809 Liberty Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15222.


          4. **Comparison**: Both theaters are on streets that run parallel to each
          other, with Penn Ave being slightly south of Liberty Ave. Given this, the
          Harris Theater would be considered north of the O''Reilly Theater.


          5. **Conclusion**: Based on the comparison of their locations within Pittsburgh,

          and valleys.


          3. **Compare Positions**: To compare the positions of the theaters, we consider
          their addresses or specific locations within Pittsburgh. Without specific
          addresses, we can''t definitively say which is north of the other, as both

      final_answer: 'YES'
      response: "To answer this question, let's break it down into steps:\n\n1. **Identify\
        \ Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both the Harris\
        \ Theater and the O'Reilly Theater in Pittsburgh, PA. \n\n2. **Harris Theater\
        \ Location**: The Harris Theater is located in downtown Pittsburgh. Specifically,\
        \ it's on Liberty Avenue.\n\n3. **O'Reilly Theater Location**: The O'Reilly\
        \ Theater, also in downtown Pittsburgh, is known to be on 6th Street and Penn\
        \ Avenue.\n\n4. **Compare Locations**: To determine if the Harris Theater\
        \ is north of the O'Reilly Theater, we need to understand the layout of downtown\
        \ Pittsburgh. Generally, the streets in Pittsburgh are laid out in a grid\
        \ pattern, with the Allegheny River to the north and the Monongahela River\
        \ to the south. The closer you are to the Allegheny River, the more north\
        \ you are in the city.\n\n5. **Street Grid**: In Pittsburgh's grid, as you\
        \ move north, you are moving towards the Allegheny River. Liberty Avenue,\
        \ where the Harris Theater is located, runs east-west. 6th Street and Penn\
        \ Avenue, where the O'Reilly Theater is, also fall within this grid system.\n\
        \n6. **Specific Addresses**: Without exact addresses, we rely on general knowledge\
        \ of the area. The Harris Theater is at 809 Liberty Avenue, and the O'Reilly\
        \ Theater is at 621 Penn Avenue. \n\n7. **Determine North-South Orientation**:\
        \ Given the grid system and general locations, we determine their relative\
        \ positions. Both theaters are in the downtown area, relatively close to each\
        \ other, and the difference in their locations would be based on the specific\
        \ intersection and block they are on.\n\n8. **Conclusion**: Given that both\
        \ theaters are in downtown Pittsburgh and close to each other, without precise\
        \ GPS coordinates or a detailed map, it might seem challenging to definitively\
        \ say one is north of the other. However, considering typical street layouts\
        \ and assuming the Harris Theater on Liberty Avenue and the O'Reilly Theater\
        \ on Penn Avenue are relatively central, their north-south positioning can\
        \ be estimated based on the downtown grid. \n\nGiven the addresses (809 Liberty\
        \ Avenue for Harris Theater and 621 Penn Avenue for O'Reilly Theater), and\
        \ knowing the layout of downtown Pittsburgh, we can make an educated guess.\
        \ Penn Avenue runs parallel to Liberty Avenue, and the numbers suggest their\
        \ relative east-west positioning rather than north-south. However, considering\
        \ the grid and assuming the numbering system reflects distance from a central\
        \ point or river, we can estimate their positions.\n\nGiven the information\
        \ and typical layouts, the Harris Theater, being on Liberty Avenue, and the\
        \ O'Reilly Theater, being on Penn Avenue, and considering the general flow\
        \ of Pittsburgh's streets, it appears the Harris Theater could be slightly\
        \ north or very close in latitude to the O'Reilly Theater due to the parallel\
        \ nature of their streets and the close proximity of their addresses within\
        \ the downtown area.\n\n**Final Answer: YES**\n\n"

        response: 'To determine if 257 Central Park West, NY is located south of Brick
          Presbyterian Church in New York City, we need to consider the following
          steps:


          1. **Identify the locations**: We know that both locations are in New York
          City (NY), so we need to find their specific addresses or landmarks.

          2. **Find the addresses**: 257 Central Park West is an address on the Upper
          West Side of Manhattan. Brick Presbyterian Church is located at 1140 Park
          Avenue, also in Manhattan.

          3. **Determine the relative positions**: We need to compare the positions
          of these two locations in relation to each other. This can be done by using
          a map or understanding the general layout of Manhattan.

          4. **Consider the layout of Manhattan**: Manhattan is laid out in a grid
          pattern, with avenues running north-south and streets running east-west.
          Central Park is located on the west side of Manhattan, and Park Avenue is
          located on the east side.

          5. **Determine the relative positions**: Since Central Park West is on the
          west side of Manhattan and Park Avenue is on the east side, we can conclude
          that 257 Central Park West is located west of Brick Presbyterian Church.

          6. **Evaluate the question**: The question asks if 257 Central Park West
          is located south of Brick Presbyterian Church. Since we determined that
          257 Central Park West is west of Brick Presbyterian Church, it cannot be
          south of it.

        \ **Identify Locations**: \n   - Star Lite Motel is located in Minnesota (MN).\n\
        \   - Lake Steilacoom is in Washington (WA).\n\n2. **Understand Geographic\
        \ Terms**:\n   - \"North of\" means that the location in question (Star Lite\
        \ Motel) is situated to the north, relative to the other location (Lake Steilacoom).\n\
        \n3. **General US Geography Knowledge**:\n   - Minnesota is generally considered\
        \ to be in the northern part of the United States, often thought of as part\
        \ of the Upper Midwest or the northern tier of states.\n   - Washington is\
        \ on the West Coast, spanning a significant portion of the western United\
        \ States.\n\n4. **Compare Locations**:\n   - Minnesota (where Star Lite Motel\
        \ is) is in the north-central part of the U.S.\n   - Washington (where Lake\
        \ Steilacoom is) is on the western edge of the U.S.\n\n5. **Determine North-South\
        \ Relationship**:\n   - Minnesota is generally north of Washington in a way\
        \ that would universally apply. However, considering the general positioning:\n\
        \     - The northern parts of Washington can be at a similar latitude to the\
        \ southern parts of Minnesota, but overall, significant portions of Washington\
        \ are south of Minnesota due to Washington's long north-south geography.\n\
        \n6. **Conclusion Based on Latitude**:\n   - Since Star Lite Motel, Minnesota,\
        \ is in the north-central part of the United States and Lake Steilacoom, Washington,\
        \ is on the West Coast, to determine if Star Lite Motel is north of Lake Steilacoom,\
        \ we need to consider their latitudes. Without exact coordinates, we can use\
        \ general knowledge:\n     - Minnesota's latitude ranges approximately from\
        \ 43\xB0N to 49\xB0N.\n     - Washington's latitude ranges from about 45\xB0\
        N to 49\xB0N.\n\nGiven the ranges, it's evident that significant parts of\
        \ Minnesota are north of Washington. However, without specific latitudes for\
        \ Star Lite Motel and Lake Steilacoom, the question becomes about their general\
        \ positions.\n\n- Star Lite Motel, being in Minnesota, has a latitude that\
        \ would generally place it north of the majority of Washington, especially\
        \ the southern parts.\n\n7. **Final Consideration**:\n   - Since Lake Steilacoom\
        \ is in Washington, which spans a significant north-south distance, and without\
        \ knowing its exact location within Washington, we must consider if Star Lite\
        \ Motel could be north of any part of Washington where Lake Steilacoom might\
        \ be. Given that the northern parts of Washington can be at a similar latitude\
        \ to the southern parts of Minnesota, the key is the specific location of\
        \ Lake Steilacoom within Washington.\n\n**Given the lack of specific information\
        \ about Lake Steilacoom's location within Washington and considering general\
        \ geographic principles:**\n\nIf Lake Steilacoom is in the northern part of\
        \ Washington, then Star Lite Motel would likely be north of it. However, if\
        \ Lake Steilacoom is in the southern part of Washington, Star Lite Motel could\
        \ still be north of it, but it would depend on the specific latitude of the\
        \ lake.\n\n**Assuming a general scenario without precise coordinates:**\n\n\

          Pennsylvania, and the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception is also in
          Philadelphia.


          2. **Understand geographical directions**: "South" refers to the direction

          3. **Compare the positions of both locations**: Since both St. Laurentius
          Parish and the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception are in the same city
          (Philadelphia), we can assume they are relatively close to each other. However,
          we need to determine if St. Laurentius Parish is located south of the Cathedral.

          3. **Consider the relative positions of the two locations**: Since both
          St. Laurentius Parish and the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception are
          in the same city (Philadelphia, PA), we need to determine if one is south
          of the other within the city.


          4. **Use geographical knowledge or research**: To determine the relative
          positions, you can use a map of Philadelphia or look up the locations on
          a mapping service like Google Maps.

      response: 'To answer this question, let''s break down the steps:


        1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of the
        two structures. Both the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception and St. Laurentius
        Parish are located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.


        2. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: Next, we need to determine the geographic
        relationship between the two locations within Philadelphia. This requires
        a detailed understanding of the layout of the city and the relative positions
        of the two structures.


        3. **Specific Locations**: Now, we need to consider the specific locations
        of the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception and St. Laurentius Parish within
        Philadelphia. The Cathedral is located in the Logan Square neighborhood, and
        St. Laurentius Parish is located in the Fishtown neighborhood. Given this
        information, we can infer that the Cathedral is more centrally located in
        the city, while St. Laurentius Parish is in a more northern and eastern part
        of the city.


        4. **Conclusion**: Based on the relative locations within Philadelphia and
        the geographic relationship between the two structures, we can conclude that
        the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception is not located south of St. Laurentius
        Parish. Instead, it is more centrally located, while St. Laurentius Parish
        is in a more northern and eastern part of the city.

        1. **Identify Locations**: Both the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception
        and St. Laurentius Parish are located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This
        means they are in the same city and state.


        2. **Consider Geographic Positions**: Since they are in the same city, we
        need to determine their relative positions within Philadelphia. The Cathedral
        of the Immaculate Conception is located in the Logan Square neighborhood,
        which is in the central part of the city. St. Laurentius Parish is located
        in the Fishtown neighborhood, which is in the northeast part of the city.


        3. **Compare Relative Positions**: To determine if the Cathedral of the Immaculate
        Conception is south of St. Laurentius Parish, we need to consider their positions
        within Philadelphia. Given that the Cathedral is in the central part of the
        city and St. Laurentius Parish is in the northeast part, the Cathedral would
        not be south of St. Laurentius Parish.


        4. **Conclusion**: Based on their relative positions within Philadelphia,

          is located in Rochester, New York, which is in the northwestern part of
          New York State, near Lake Ontario.


          4. **Geographical Comparison**: Now, we need to compare the geographical
          positions of these two locations. Idaho is generally west and north of New
          York. Given that Rochester is in the northwestern part of New York State,

          northern part of the state. Trinity Dam is located in Trinity County, California,
          also in the northern part of the state.


          2. **Compare Positions**: To compare their positions, we consider their
          proximity to major cities or landmarks. Eureka, where Carson Mansion is
          located, is on the coast of Northern California. Trinity Dam is located
          in the interior of the state, closer to the center of Northern California.


          3. **Determine North-South Orientation**: Given that both locations are
          in Northern California, the determining factor will be their relative positions
          along the north-south axis. Eureka, being on the coast, suggests that Carson
          Mansion is positioned relatively north compared to other parts of Northern
          California.


          4. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical locations, Carson Mansion is
          north of Trinity Dam because Eureka is on the northern coast of California,

        response: 'To determine if the Carson Mansion in California is located north
          of Trinity Dam, also in California, we need to consider the geographical
          locations of both.


          1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify where each location
          is. The Carson Mansion is located in Eureka, California. Trinity Dam is
          located in Trinity County, California, on the Trinity River.


          2. **Compare Positions**: To compare their positions, we consider their
          proximity to major cities or landmarks. Eureka is a coastal city in northern
          California, while Trinity Dam is located in the northern part of the state,
          but more inland.


          3. **Determine North-South Orientation**: Given that both locations are
          in California, the determining factor will be their relative positions along
          the north-south axis. Eureka, being on the coast, is generally considered
          to be in the northern part of the state. Trinity Dam, while also in the
          northern part of the state, is more centrally located.


          4. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical locations, the Carson Mansion
          in Eureka is located north of Trinity Dam because Eureka is closer to the
          northern border of California.

          3. **Determine North-South Orientation**: Given that both locations are
          in northern California, we need to determine their relative positions along
          the north-south axis. Trinity Dam is situated more towards the east, which,
          in the context of California''s geography, means it''s relatively north
          compared to other locations in northern California.


          4. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical locations, Carson Mansion is
          south of Trinity Dam because Trinity Dam is located more towards the eastern
          part of northern California, placing it more to the north in the context

          to the south of Cathedral of Saints Simon and Jude.

          4. Compare the positions: Based on the relative positions, Birmingham, Alabama,
          is located to the east of Phoenix, Arizona. However, it is not located to

        response: 'To answer this question, I''ll break it down into steps:


          1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
          the Carraway Methodist Medical Center in Alabama (AL) and the Cathedral
          of Saints Simon and Jude in Phoenix, Arizona (AZ).


          2. **Carraway Methodist Medical Center, AL**: This structure is located
          in Birmingham, Alabama. Alabama is a state in the southeastern United States.


          3. **Cathedral of Saints Simon and Jude, AZ**: This cathedral is located
          in Phoenix, Arizona. Arizona is a state in the southwestern United States.


          4. **Geographical Comparison**: Next, we compare the geographical positions
          of these two locations. Alabama is generally east of Arizona. Given that
          the Cathedral of Saints Simon and Jude is in Phoenix, Arizona, we need to
          determine if Carraway Methodist Medical Center in Alabama is south of it.


          5. **Determine Direction**: Considering the United States'' geography, Alabama
          is indeed east of Arizona. However, being east does not necessarily mean
          being south. To be south, the location must be at a lower latitude.


          6. **Latitude Comparison**: To confirm if Carraway Methodist Medical Center
          is south of the Cathedral of Saints Simon and Jude, we need to compare their
          latitudes. If the latitude of the medical center is lower than that of the
          cathedral, it would be considered south.


          7. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical locations and latitude comparison,
          the Carraway Methodist Medical Center in Alabama is not south of the Cathedral
          of Saints Simon and Jude in Phoenix, Arizona.

          \ guess or an acknowledgment that specific coordinates are needed for a\

        response: 'To determine whether Glenn Cunningham Lake in Nebraska is located
          south of Betts House at Yale University in Connecticut, we need to follow
          these steps:


          1. **Identify the locations**: Glenn Cunningham Lake is in Nebraska (NE),
          and Betts House is at Yale University in Connecticut (CT).


          2. **Understand the concept of "south"**: "South" refers to a direction
          on a map or globe, where the equator is considered the "zero" point, and
          the south pole is at the bottom.


          3. **Compare the geographical locations**: Nebraska (NE) is a state in the
          central United States, while Connecticut (CT) is a state on the east coast
          of the United States.


          4. **Consider the latitude of both locations**: Nebraska has a latitude
          that is generally north of Connecticut''s latitude. This means that Nebraska
          is located farther north than Connecticut.


          5. **Conclusion**: Since Nebraska is generally north of Connecticut, it
          follows that Glenn Cunningham Lake in Nebraska is not located south of Betts

      response: 'To answer this question, let''s break down the steps:


        1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Betts
        House (Yale University), CT, and Glenn Cunningham Lake, NE. Betts House is
        located in Connecticut, and Glenn Cunningham Lake is located in Nebraska.


        2. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: Next, we need to determine the geographic
        relationship between Connecticut and Nebraska. Connecticut is located on the
        East Coast of the United States, and Nebraska is located in the Midwest.


        3. **Specific Locations**: Now, we need to consider the specific locations
        within these states. Betts House is in Connecticut, and Glenn Cunningham Lake
        is in Nebraska. Given that Connecticut is located east of Nebraska, we can
        infer that any location in Connecticut is generally east of any location in
        Nebraska, assuming we''re comparing locations that are relatively close to
        the state borders or not significantly displaced eastward or westward within
        their respective states.


        4. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geographic relationship between Connecticut
        and Nebraska, and without needing the exact coordinates or a detailed map,
        we can conclude that Betts House (Yale University), CT, is not located south
        of Glenn Cunningham Lake, NE, given the state-level geographic relationship.


        Therefore, the answer is: **NO**'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/identical/the
        same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because they are "within the same general
        area" and because it lacks precise information. Being in the "same general
        area" is not the same as being at equal coordinates/positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with a clear "NO" answer, marked
        in a box. While it discusses uncertainty earlier, it ultimately commits to
        this answer, even if the reasoning seems uncertain. We must take the explicit
        final answer at face value.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      response: 'To answer this question, let''s break down the steps:


        1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
        the All Saints'' Episcopal Church in Beverly Hills, California, and the Our
        Lady of Mt. Lebanon-St. Peter Cathedral in Los Angeles, California. Both churches
        are located in California.


        2. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: Next, we need to determine the geographic
        relationship between Beverly Hills and Los Angeles. Beverly Hills is a city
        located within Los Angeles County, California. This means that Beverly Hills
        is generally located within the same general area as Los Angeles.


        3. **Specific Locations**: Now, we need to consider the specific locations
        within Beverly Hills and Los Angeles. The All Saints'' Episcopal Church is
        located in Beverly Hills, and the Our Lady of Mt. Lebanon-St. Peter Cathedral
        is located in Los Angeles. Given that Beverly Hills is located within Los
        Angeles County, we can infer that any location in Beverly Hills is generally
        within the same geographic area as Los Angeles, assuming we''re comparing
        locations that are relatively close within these areas.


        4. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geographic relationship between Beverly
        Hills and Los Angeles, and without needing the exact coordinates or a detailed
        map, we can conclude that the All Saints'' Episcopal Church in Beverly Hills
        is indeed located within the same general area as the Our Lady of Mt. Lebanon-St.
        Peter Cathedral in Los Angeles. However, the specific question asks if the
        All Saints'' Episcopal Church is located **south** of the Our Lady of Mt.
        Lebanon-St. Peter Cathedral. This requires a more precise determination of
        their relative north-south positions within the Los Angeles metropolitan area.


        5. **Refining the Answer**: To determine if the All Saints'' Episcopal Church
        is specifically south of the Our Lady of Mt. Lebanon-St. Peter Cathedral,
        we would need more precise information about their locations within Los Angeles.
        If they are both within the central part of Los Angeles or in relatively close
        proximity, the answer would likely be $\boxed{NO}$, as they would be within
        the same general area. However, if the churches are in different parts of
        Los Angeles, such as one being in the northern part and the other in the southern
        part, the answer could be $\boxed{YES}$, depending on their exact positions.


        Therefore, without more specific information about their locations within
        Los Angeles, the answer is: $\boxed{NO}$

        \ (St. Mary Basilica) is situated to the north, relative to the other location\
        \ (Lake Waco).\n\n3. **General US Geography Knowledge**:\n   - Mississippi\
        \ is generally considered to be in the southeastern part of the United States.\n\
        \   - Texas is in the southern-central part of the U.S.\n\n4. **Compare Locations**:\n\
        \   - Mississippi (where St. Mary Basilica is) is east of Texas (where Lake\
        \ Waco is).\n\n5. **Determine North-South Relationship**:\n   - Generally,\
        \ Mississippi is not significantly north of Texas in a way that would universally\
        \ apply (since parts of Texas are at a similar latitude to parts of Mississippi,\
        \ and some areas of Texas are even north of Mississippi). However, considering\

        \ similar latitude to the southern parts of Mississippi, but overall, significant\
        \ portions of Texas are south of Mississippi due to Texas's long north-south\
        \ geography.\n\n6. **Conclusion Based on Latitude**:\n   - Since St. Mary\
        \ Basilica, Natchez, is more towards the eastern United States and Lake Waco,\
        \ Texas, is in the southern-central U.S., to determine if St. Mary Basilica\
        \ is north of Lake Waco, we need to consider their latitudes. Without exact\
        \ coordinates, we can use general knowledge:\n     - Mississippi's latitude\
        \ ranges approximately from 30\xB0N to 35\xB0N.\n     - Texas's latitude ranges\
        \ from about 26\xB0N to 37\xB0N.\n\nGiven the ranges, it's possible for parts\
        \ of Texas (especially the northern parts) to be at a higher latitude (more\

        \   - Since Lake Waco is in Texas, which spans a significant north-south distance,\
        \ and without knowing its exact location within Texas, we must consider if\
        \ St. Mary Basilica could be north of any part of Texas where Lake Waco might\
        \ be. Given that some parts of Texas are north of Mississippi's latitude,\
        \ the key is the specific location of Lake Waco within Texas.\n\n**Given the\
        \ lack of specific information about Lake Waco's location within Texas and\
        \ considering general geographic principles:**\n\nIf Lake Waco is in the southern\
        \ part of Texas, then St. Mary Basilica could indeed be north of it. However,\

        \ is generally considered to be in the southern part of the United States.\n\
        \   - Texas is in the southern-central part of the United States.\n\n4. **Compare\
        \ Locations**:\n   - Mississippi is east of Texas, but their latitudes (north-south\
        \ positioning) are not significantly different.\n\n5. **Determine North-South\
        \ Relationship**:\n   - Since both states are in the southern part of the\
        \ U.S., the difference in their north-south positioning is not substantial.\
        \ However, considering the general positioning:\n     - The northern parts\
        \ of Texas can be at a similar latitude to the southern parts of Mississippi,\
        \ but overall, significant portions of Texas are south of Mississippi due\
        \ to Texas's long north-south geography.\n\n6. **Conclusion Based on Latitude**:\n\
        \   - Since St. Mary Basilica, Natchez, Mississippi, is in the southern United\
        \ States and Lake Waco, Waco, Texas, is also in the southern United States,\
        \ to determine if St. Mary Basilica is north of Lake Waco, we need to consider\
        \ their latitudes. Without exact coordinates, we can use general knowledge:\n\
        \     - Mississippi's latitude ranges approximately from 30\xB0N to 35\xB0\
        N.\n     - Texas's latitude ranges from about 26\xB0N to 37\xB0N.\n\nGiven\
        \ the ranges, it's possible for parts of Texas (especially the northern parts)\
        \ to be at a higher latitude (more north) than Mississippi. However, without\
        \ specific latitudes for St. Mary Basilica and Lake Waco, the question becomes\
        \ about their general positions.\n\n- St. Mary Basilica, being in Mississippi,\
        \ has a latitude that would generally place it south of the northern parts\
        \ of Texas but could be north of the southern parts of Texas.\n\n7. **Final\
        \ Consideration**:\n   - Since Lake Waco is in Texas, which spans a significant\
        \ north-south distance, and without knowing its exact location within Texas,\
        \ we must consider if St. Mary Basilica could be north of any part of Texas\
        \ where Lake Waco might be. Given that some parts of Texas are north of Mississippi's\
        \ latitude, the key is the specific location of Lake Waco within Texas.\n\n\
        **Given the lack of specific information about Lake Waco's location within\
        \ Texas and considering general geographic principles:**\n\nIf Lake Waco is\
        \ in the southern part of Texas, then St. Mary Basilica could indeed be north\
        \ of it. However, if Lake Waco is in the northern part of Texas, St. Mary\

        O''Neill Forebay is located in California.


        2. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: Next, we need to determine the geographic
        relationship between Virginia and California. Virginia is located on the East
        Coast of the United States, and California is located on the West Coast. Virginia
        is generally east of California.


        3. **Specific Locations**: Now, we need to consider the specific locations
        within these states. Claytor Dam is in Virginia, and O''Neill Forebay is in
        California. Given that Virginia is east of California, we can infer that any
        location in Virginia is generally east of any location in California, assuming
        we''re comparing locations that are relatively close to the state borders
        or not significantly displaced eastward or westward within their respective
        states.


        4. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geographic relationship between Virginia
        and California, and without needing the exact coordinates or a detailed map,
        we can conclude that Claytor Dam, VA, is not located south of O''Neill Forebay,
        CA. Instead, it is located east of it.

          central part of the state. Lake Tahoma, on the other hand, is in the western
          part of North Carolina.


          3. **Compare the locations**: To determine if the Duke Energy Center is
          south of Lake Tahoma, we need to compare their positions on a map. The western
          part of North Carolina, where Lake Tahoma is located, is generally north

        response: 'To determine if Flagstaff Lake (Maine), ME is located north of
          Lac qui Parle, MN, we need to establish the geographical locations of both
          lakes.


          1. **Identify Locations**: First, let''s identify where each lake is located.
          Flagstaff Lake is situated in the western part of Maine, near the border
          with Canada. Lac qui Parle is located in western Minnesota, near the South
          Dakota border.


          2. **Consider General US Geography**: Generally, Maine is considered one
          of the northernmost states in the United States, while Minnesota is in the
          midwest but still north of many other states.


          3. **Compare Specific Locations**: Both lakes are in the northern parts
          of their respective states. However, Maine is significantly farther north
          than Minnesota, especially when considering the location of Flagstaff Lake
          near the Canadian border.


          4. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical locations, Flagstaff Lake,
          ME, is located north of Lac qui Parle, MN, given that Maine is significantly
          farther north in the United States.

      response: 'To answer this question, let''s break down the steps:


        1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of St.
        Joseph Cathedral (Buffalo, New York), NY, and C. J. Strike Dam, ID. St. Joseph
        Cathedral is located in Buffalo, New York, and C. J. Strike Dam is located
        in Idaho.


        2. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: Next, we need to determine the geographic
        relationship between New York and Idaho. New York is located in the northeastern
        part of the United States, while Idaho is located in the northwestern part.


        3. **Specific Locations**: Now, we need to consider the specific locations
        within these states. St. Joseph Cathedral is in Buffalo, which is in the western
        part of New York, and C. J. Strike Dam is in Idaho, which is a western state.
        Given the general geographic relationship between New York and Idaho, it''s
        clear that any location in New York is generally east of any location in Idaho,
        assuming we''re comparing locations that are relatively close to the state
        borders or not significantly displaced northward or southward within their
        respective states.


        4. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geographic relationship between New
        York and Idaho, and without needing the exact coordinates or a detailed map,
        we can conclude that St. Joseph Cathedral (Buffalo, New York), NY, is indeed
        located south of C. J. Strike Dam, ID, given the state-level geographic relationship.


        Therefore, the answer is: **YES**'

        structures. St. Joseph Cathedral is in Buffalo, New York, which is in the
        northeastern part of the United States. C. J. Strike Dam is in Idaho, which
        is in the northwestern part of the United States.

        geographic relationship between New York and Idaho. New York is located significantly
        east of Idaho.


        3. **Specific Locations**: Now, we need to consider the specific locations
        within these states. St. Joseph Cathedral is in Buffalo, New York, which is
        in the western part of the state. C. J. Strike Dam is in Idaho. Given the
        vast distance between the two states, it''s unlikely that a location in New
        York would be south of a location in Idaho, especially when the New York location
        is in the western part of the state.


        4. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographic relationship between New York and

        conclude that St. Joseph Cathedral, NY, is not located south of C. J. Strike
        Dam, ID, given the significant distance and general geographic orientation

      final_answer: 'NO'
      response: 'To determine if Wright Patman Lake, TX is located south of Jim Chapman
        Lake, TX, we need to break down the problem into steps:


        1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to establish the locations of both
        lakes. Wright Patman Lake is located in northeast Texas, near Texarkana. Jim
        Chapman Lake, also known as Cooper Lake, is located in northeast Texas as
        well, near Cooper.


        2. **Determine Relative Positions**: Next, we need to compare the relative
        positions of the two lakes. Both lakes are in the same general region, northeast
        Texas, but they are not in the same exact location. Wright Patman Lake is
        closer to the border with Arkansas, while Jim Chapman Lake is more centrally
        located in Texas.


        3. **Consider Geographic Directions**: We need to establish if Wright Patman
        Lake is indeed south of Jim Chapman Lake. To do this, we can consider the
        general geographic layout of Texas. Northeast Texas is in the northern part
        of the state, and within this region, Wright Patman Lake is more to the north
        and west compared to Jim Chapman Lake, which is more to the south and east.

        we can conclude that Wright Patman Lake, TX is not located south of Jim Chapman

      final_answer: 'NO'
      response: 'To determine if Wright Patman Lake, TX is located south of Jim Chapman
        Lake, TX, let''s break down the steps:


        1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
        lakes in Texas. Wright Patman Lake is located in the northeastern part of
        Texas, near Texarkana. Jim Chapman Lake (also known as Cooper Lake) is located
        in the northeastern part of Texas, near Sulphur Springs.


        2. **Compare Positions**: Next, we need to compare the positions of the two
        lakes. Both lakes are in the northeastern part of Texas, but Wright Patman
        Lake is slightly further north and east compared to Jim Chapman Lake.


        3. **Conclusion**: Given that Wright Patman Lake is more to the north and
        east compared to Jim Chapman Lake, and considering they are both in the northeastern
        part of Texas, we can infer that Wright Patman Lake is not located south of
        Jim Chapman Lake.


        Therefore, the answer is: $\boxed{NO}$

          in terms of north-south orientation.


          After researching, I found that:


          - The Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul is located in Lewiston, Maine.

          - IBM Rochester is located in Rochester, Minnesota.


          Since both locations are in different states, I need to consider their relative
          positions within the United States. Given that specific addresses or exact
          locations within the states are not provided, and assuming the question
          aims to test general knowledge or understanding of these locations'' relative
          positions, I must consider if there''s a known geographical relationship
          or landmark that could help determine if one is south of the other.


          Without specific addresses or a detailed map, I must rely on general knowledge
          or available data. However, without precise locations or a map, determining
          the exact north-south relationship between these two points in the United
          States is challenging.

      response: 'To answer this question, let''s break down the steps:


        1. **Identify Locations**: Improv Asylum is in Boston, Massachusetts. Kendall
        Cogeneration Station is also in Boston, Massachusetts.


        2. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: Since both locations are in Boston,
        we need to compare their positions within the city.


        3. **Specific Locations**: Improv Asylum is located at 216 Hanover Street,
        Boston, MA 02113. Kendall Cogeneration Station is located at 1 Broadway, Cambridge,
        MA 02142.


        4. **Compare Positions**: 1 Broadway, Cambridge, is located just across the
        Charles River from Boston, and it''s generally considered part of the greater
        Boston area. It''s slightly northwest of the center of Boston.


        5. **Conclusion**: Given that Kendall Cogeneration Station is located slightly
        northwest of the center of Boston, and Improv Asylum is within Boston, it''s
        reasonable to conclude that Improv Asylum is not south of Kendall Cogeneration
        Station.

          is west of Alabama, and the United States is conventionally oriented with
          north at the top, Texas would be considered north of Alabama.

        \ **Identify Locations**: \n   - Lake Martin is located in Alabama, AL.\n\
        \   - Dal-Tex Building is in Texas, TX.\n\n2. **Understand Geographic Terms**:\n\
        \   - \"North of\" means that the location in question (Lake Martin) is situated\
        \ to the north, relative to the other location (Dal-Tex Building).\n\n3. **General\
        \ US Geography Knowledge**:\n   - Alabama (where Lake Martin is) is generally\
        \ considered to be in the southeastern part of the United States.\n   - Texas\
        \ (where Dal-Tex Building is) is in the southern central part of the United\
        \ States.\n\n4. **Compare Locations**:\n   - Alabama is east of Texas, both\
        \ being in the southern part of the U.S.\n\n5. **Determine North-South Relationship**:\n\
        \   - The north-south relationship between Alabama and Texas is not as straightforward\
        \ as their east-west relationship. Both states span a significant north-south\
        \ distance, and parts of each state can be at similar latitudes.\n\n6. **Consider\
        \ Specific Locations**:\n   - Without specific coordinates for Lake Martin\
        \ and Dal-Tex Building, we need to consider their general positions within\
        \ their respective states.\n   - Lake Martin is in Alabama, which has a latitude\
        \ range of approximately 30\xB0N to 35\xB0N.\n   - Dal-Tex Building is in\
        \ Texas, which has a latitude range of approximately 26\xB0N to 36.5\xB0N.\n\
        \nGiven the ranges, it's possible for parts of Texas (especially the northern\
        \ parts) to be at a higher latitude (more north) than Alabama. However, without\
        \ specific latitudes for Lake Martin and Dal-Tex Building, the question becomes\
        \ about their general positions.\n\n- Lake Martin, being in Alabama, has a\
        \ latitude that would generally place it south of the northern parts of Texas\
        \ but could be north of the southern parts of Texas.\n\n7. **Final Consideration**:\n\
        \   - Since Dal-Tex Building is in Texas, which spans a significant north-south\
        \ distance, and without knowing its exact location within Texas, we must consider\
        \ if Lake Martin could be north of any part of Texas where Dal-Tex Building\
        \ might be. Given that some parts of Texas are north of Alabama's latitude,\
        \ the key is the specific location of Dal-Tex Building within Texas.\n\n**Given\
        \ the lack of specific information about Dal-Tex Building's location within\
        \ Texas and considering general geographic principles:**\n\nIf Dal-Tex Building\
        \ is in the southern part of Texas, then Lake Martin could indeed be north\
        \ of it. However, if Dal-Tex Building is in the northern part of Texas, Lake\
        \ Martin would likely be south of it.\n\n**Assuming a general scenario without\

        5. **Determine North-South Relationship**:\n   - Alabama is not significantly\

        \ are at a similar latitude to parts of Alabama, and some areas of Texas are\
        \ even north of Alabama). However, considering the general positioning:\n\

        \ Alabama due to Texas's long north-south geography.\n\n6. **Conclusion Based\
        \ on Latitude**:\n   - Since Lake Martin, Alabama, is more towards the southeastern\
        \ United States and Dal-Tex Building, Texas, is in the southern central part\
        \ of the U.S., to determine if Lake Martin is north of Dal-Tex Building, we\

        final_answer: 'YES'
        response: 'To determine if the Eighth & Main building in Idaho is located
          south of Arrowrock Dam, also in Idaho, we need to follow these steps:


          1. **Identify the locations**: Eighth & Main is a building located in Boise,
          Idaho. Arrowrock Dam is a dam located on the Boise River in Elmore County,
          Idaho, northeast of Boise.


          2. **Understand geographical directions**: "South" means a location is farther
          south than the reference point.


          3. **Compare the locations'' general positions**: Boise is generally located
          in the southwestern part of Idaho. Arrowrock Dam is northeast of Boise,
          which means it is in the eastern part of Idaho.


          4. **Consider the specific locations within the state**: While Eighth &
          Main is in Boise, which is in the southwestern part of Idaho, Arrowrock
          Dam is in the eastern part of Idaho. This suggests that Eighth & Main is
          likely south of Arrowrock Dam.


          5. **Latitude Comparison**: To confirm this, we can compare the latitudes
          of both locations. If the latitude of Eighth & Main is lower (more south)
          than that of Arrowrock Dam, it confirms that Eighth & Main is indeed south
          of Arrowrock Dam.


          6. **Conclusion**: Given the general positions of Boise and Arrowrock Dam
          in Idaho, and considering the specific locations within the state, it is
          likely that Eighth & Main in Boise is south of Arrowrock Dam.


          The final answer is: $\boxed{YES}$

        response: 'To determine whether Eighth & Main in Idaho is located south of
          Arrowrock Dam in Idaho, we need to follow these steps:


          1. **Identify the locations**: Eighth & Main is a building located in Boise,
          Idaho. Arrowrock Dam is a dam located on the Boise River in Elmore County,
          Idaho.


          2. **Understand geographical directions**: "South of" means the location
          in question (Eighth & Main) must be farther south than the reference point
          (Arrowrock Dam).


          3. **Determine the relative positions**: Since both locations are in Idaho,
          we need to determine if Boise (where Eighth & Main is located) is south
          of the area near Arrowrock Dam.


          4. **Consider the general geography of Idaho**: Boise is located in the
          southwestern part of Idaho, while Arrowrock Dam is located in the central
          part of the state.


          5. **Latitude comparison**: If we compare the latitudes of Boise and the
          area near Arrowrock Dam, we find that Boise is at a lower latitude (further
          south) than the area near Arrowrock Dam.


          Given these steps, since Boise is located further south than the area near
          Arrowrock Dam, we can conclude that Eighth & Main in Boise, Idaho, is indeed
          located south of Arrowrock Dam in Idaho.

      response: 'To determine if Muskingum River Power Plant, OH is located south
        of Dillon Reservoir, CO, we need to follow these steps:


        1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
        structures. Muskingum River Power Plant is located in Ohio, and Dillon Reservoir
        is located in Colorado.


        2. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: Next, we need to determine the geographic
        relationship between Ohio and Colorado. Ohio is located in the Midwest region
        of the United States, while Colorado is located in the western part of the
        country.


        3. **Specific Locations**: Now, we need to consider the specific locations
        within these states. Muskingum River Power Plant is in Ohio, and Dillon Reservoir
        is in Colorado. Given that Ohio is east of Colorado, we can infer that any
        location in Ohio is generally east of any location in Colorado, assuming we''re
        comparing locations that are relatively close to the state borders or not
        significantly displaced eastward or westward within their respective states.


        4. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geographic relationship between Ohio
        and Colorado, and without needing the exact coordinates or a detailed map,
        we can conclude that Muskingum River Power Plant, OH, is indeed located south
        of Dillon Reservoir, CO, given the state-level geographic relationship.

          is an eastern state. Dillon Reservoir is in central Colorado, and Muskingum

          3. **Consider the general geography of Pennsylvania**: Pennsylvania is a
          long, rectangular state in the northeastern United States. The northern
          part of the state is closer to New York, while the southern part borders
          Maryland.

      response: 'To determine if the Basilica of Saints Cyril and Methodius in Danville,
        Pennsylvania, is located south of Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir in Pennsylvania,
        we need to follow a series of steps:


        1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
        structures. The Basilica of Saints Cyril and Methodius is located in Danville,
        Pennsylvania, and Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir is also located in Pennsylvania.


        2. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: Next, we need to determine the geographic
        relationship between Danville and the location of Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir.
        Both are within the state of Pennsylvania.


        3. **Specific Locations**: Now, we need to consider the specific locations
        within Pennsylvania. The Basilica of Saints Cyril and Methodius is located
        in Danville, which is in the northeastern part of the state. Foster Joseph
        Sayers Reservoir is located in the central part of Pennsylvania.


        4. **Compare Locations**: Given that both locations are within the same state,
        we can compare their relative positions. Danville, where the Basilica is located,
        is in the northeastern part of Pennsylvania. The central part of Pennsylvania,
        where Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir is located, is generally south of the
        northeastern part.


        5. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geographic relationship between the
        northeastern and central parts of Pennsylvania, and without needing the exact
        coordinates or a detailed map, we can conclude that the Basilica of Saints
        Cyril and Methodius in Danville, Pennsylvania, is indeed located north of

      final_answer: 'YES'
      response: "To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1.\
        \ **Identify Locations**: \n   - Pomme de Terre Lake is located in Missouri,\
        \ MO.\n   - New Melones Dam is in California, CA.\n\n2. **Understand Geographic\
        \ Terms**:\n   - \"North of\" means that the location in question (Pomme de\
        \ Terre Lake) is situated to the north, relative to the other location (New\
        \ Melones Dam).\n\n3. **General US Geography Knowledge**:\n   - Missouri is\
        \ generally considered to be in the central part of the United States, often\
        \ thought of as part of the Midwest.\n   - California is on the West Coast,\
        \ spanning a significant portion of the western United States.\n\n4. **Compare\
        \ Locations**:\n   - Missouri (where Pomme de Terre Lake is) is more towards\
        \ the central United States.\n   - California (where New Melones Dam is) is\
        \ on the western edge of the U.S.\n\n5. **Determine North-South Relationship**:\n\
        \   - Missouri is not significantly north of California in a way that would\
        \ universally apply (since parts of California are at a similar latitude to\
        \ parts of Missouri, and some areas of California are even north of Missouri).\
        \ However, considering the general positioning:\n     - The northern parts\
        \ of California can be at a similar latitude to the southern parts of Missouri,\
        \ but overall, significant portions of California are south of Missouri due\
        \ to California's long north-south geography.\n\n6. **Conclusion Based on\
        \ Latitude**:\n   - Since Pomme de Terre Lake, Missouri, is more towards the\
        \ central United States and New Melones Dam, California, is on the West Coast,\
        \ to determine if Pomme de Terre Lake is north of New Melones Dam, we need\
        \ to consider their latitudes. Without exact coordinates, we can use general\
        \ knowledge:\n     - Missouri's latitude ranges approximately from 35.5\xB0\
        N to 40.5\xB0N.\n     - California's latitude ranges from about 32\xB0N to\
        \ 42\xB0N.\n\nGiven the ranges, it's possible for parts of California (especially\
        \ the northern parts) to be at a higher latitude (more north) than Missouri.\

        can conclude that the Basilica and National Shrine of Our Lady of Lebanon
        in Ohio is not located south of the Wyoming State Capitol in Wyoming.

        City Hospital, NV, and Durham Performing Arts Center, NC. Boulder City Hospital
        is located in Boulder City, Nevada, and Durham Performing Arts Center is located
        in Durham, North Carolina.


        2. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: Next, we need to determine the geographic
        relationship between Nevada and North Carolina. Nevada is located in the western
        part of the United States, and North Carolina is located in the southeastern
        part of the United States.


        3. **Specific Locations**: Now, we need to consider the specific locations
        within these states. Boulder City, Nevada, is located in the southeastern
        part of the state, while Durham, North Carolina, is located in the central
        part of the state. Given that Nevada is to the west of North Carolina, we
        can infer that any location in Nevada is generally west of any location in
        North Carolina.


        4. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geographic relationship between Nevada
        and North Carolina, and without needing the exact coordinates or a detailed
        map, we can conclude that Boulder City Hospital, NV, is not located south
        of Durham Performing Arts Center, NC. Instead, Boulder City Hospital, NV,

          Hall Seattle is in the city of Seattle, which is in the western part of
          the state.

          2. **Positions relative to each other**: Based on their locations, Banks
          Lake is situated east of Seattle, and since Seattle is in the western part
          of Washington, Banks Lake is farther east but not necessarily farther south.

          3. **Geographical context of Washington**: Washington state has a diverse
          geography, with mountain ranges, coastal areas, and inland regions. The
          Cascade Range runs north-south through the state, dividing it into eastern
          and western regions.


          Based on this information, Banks Lake is not located south of Town Hall

          First, let''s identify the locations:


          - Banks Lake, WA is a reservoir in Grant County, Washington, in the north-central
          part of the state.

          - Town Hall Seattle is a performance venue and community center located
          in the city of Seattle, Washington, in King County.


          Now, let''s consider their relative positions. Seattle is located in the
          western part of Washington state, while Banks Lake is in the north-central
          part. This means that Banks Lake is generally north of Seattle.


          However, the question is specifically about whether Banks Lake is south
          of Town Hall Seattle. To answer this, we need to consider the cardinal directions.

      response: 'To answer this question, let''s break down the steps:


        1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Town
        Hall Seattle, WA, and Banks Lake, WA. Town Hall Seattle is located in Seattle,
        Washington, which is in the western part of the state. Banks Lake is located
        in eastern Washington, near the town of Coulee City.


        2. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: Next, we need to determine the geographic
        relationship between Seattle and eastern Washington. Seattle is located in
        the western part of Washington, while Banks Lake is located in the eastern
        part of the state.


        3. **Specific Locations**: Now, we need to consider the specific locations
        within these regions. Town Hall Seattle is in Seattle, which is in the western
        part of Washington. Banks Lake is in eastern Washington, which is to the east
        of Seattle.


        4. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geographic relationship between the
        western and eastern parts of Washington, and without needing the exact coordinates
        or a detailed map, we can conclude that Town Hall Seattle, WA, is not located
        south of Banks Lake, WA, given the state-level geographic relationship.

          2. **Understand the geographical terms**: "South" in this context means
          the direction below or towards the South Pole, while "north" is the direction
          above or towards the North Pole.


          3. **Determine the relative positions of Belden Place and Queen Anne Hotel**:
          To determine whether Belden Place is located south of Queen Anne Hotel,
          we need to know their respective positions within San Francisco.


          4. **Consider the map of San Francisco**: A map of San Francisco can help
          us visualize the positions of Belden Place and Queen Anne Hotel relative
          to each other.


          5. **Compare the positions of Belden Place and Queen Anne Hotel**: Based
          on the map, we can see that Belden Place is located in the Financial District
          of San Francisco, while Queen Anne Hotel is located in the Pacific Heights
          neighborhood.


          6. **Conclusion**: Given their positions on the map, it is evident that
          Belden Place is not located south of Queen Anne Hotel. Instead, Belden Place
          is located east of Queen Anne Hotel, and both are located in the northern

          **Step 1: Identifying the locations**

          - Lake Waco is a reservoir located in Waco, Texas, which is in the central
          part of the state.

          - St. Mary Basilica is a Catholic church located in Natchez, Mississippi,
          which is in the southwestern part of the state.


          **Step 2: Determining their relative positions**

          - Texas and Mississippi are both southern states in the United States.

          - Lake Waco in Texas is further west compared to St. Mary Basilica in Mississippi,
          which is further east.

          - The general rule is that as you move east in the United States, you are
          moving northward (at least in the southern states).

          of the United States and the specific locations of Lake Waco and St. Mary
          Basilica, Lake Waco is located southwest of St. Mary Basilica.


          Given these steps, we can conclude that Lake Waco in Texas is not located
          south of St. Mary Basilica in Natchez, Mississippi.


          The final answer is: NO

          are located below the northern states.


          Given that Indiana is a midwestern state, it is likely located north of
          Maryland, which is a mid-Atlantic state. Therefore, it is highly likely
          that Lake Monroe is not located south of AFI Silver.


          Based on this reasoning, the answer to the question is: NO

        response: 'To determine if White Rock Lake, TX is located south of Kalita
          Humphreys Theater, TX, we need to follow a few steps:


          1. **Identify the locations**: White Rock Lake and Kalita Humphreys Theater
          are both located in Dallas, Texas. Since they are in the same city, we can
          assume that their positions are relative to each other within Dallas.


          2. **Understand the concept of "south"**: South means a direction that is
          generally towards the Earth''s south pole. In the context of Texas, south
          usually means a location that is farther south in latitude.


          3. **Consider the geography of Dallas**: Dallas is a large city with various
          landmarks and neighborhoods. We need to understand the relative positions
          of White Rock Lake and Kalita Humphreys Theater within the city.


          4. **Compare the locations**: Based on my knowledge of Dallas, White Rock
          Lake is located in the northeast part of the city, while Kalita Humphreys
          Theater is located in the Oak Lawn neighborhood, which is in the central
          part of Dallas.


          5. **Conclusion**: Since White Rock Lake is located in the northeast part
          of Dallas, and Kalita Humphreys Theater is in the central part, it is safe
          to assume that White Rock Lake is not located south of Kalita Humphreys

        response: 'To answer this question, we need to follow a series of steps to
          determine the relative positions of White Rock Lake and Kalita Humphreys
          Theater in Texas.


          1. **Identify the locations**: White Rock Lake is a reservoir located in
          Dallas, Texas, and Kalita Humphreys Theater is a performing arts venue also
          located in Dallas, Texas.


          2. **Understand the geographical relationship**: The question asks if White
          Rock Lake is located south of Kalita Humphreys Theater. "South of" means
          that the location in question (White Rock Lake) should be farther south
          in terms of latitude than the reference point (Kalita Humphreys Theater).


          3. **Consider the relative positions within Dallas**: Both White Rock Lake
          and Kalita Humphreys Theater are in Dallas, Texas. Dallas is a large city,
          so we need to consider their relative positions within the city.


          4. **Determine the specific locations**: White Rock Lake is in the northeast
          part of Dallas, while Kalita Humphreys Theater is located in the Turtle
          Creek area, which is in the central part of the city.


          5. **Compare the relative positions**: Since White Rock Lake is in the northeast
          part of Dallas, and Kalita Humphreys Theater is in the central part, it
          is safe to assume that White Rock Lake is generally north of Kalita Humphreys
          Theater.


          6. **Conclusion**: Based on the relative positions of these two locations
          within Dallas, Texas, we can conclude that White Rock Lake is not located

        response: 'To determine whether White Rock Lake, TX, is located south of Kalita
          Humphreys Theater, TX, we need to consider the following steps:


          1. **Identify the locations**: White Rock Lake is a reservoir located in
          Dallas, Texas, and Kalita Humphreys Theater is a performing arts venue also
          located in Dallas, Texas.


          2. **Understand geographical directions**: "South of" refers to a location
          that is farther south than the reference point. In this case, we need to
          determine if White Rock Lake is farther south than Kalita Humphreys Theater.


          3. **Compare the locations within Dallas**: Both White Rock Lake and Kalita
          Humphreys Theater are in Dallas, Texas, which means they are relatively
          close to each other within the city.


          4. **Determine the relative positions**: White Rock Lake is located east
          of the Dallas downtown area, while Kalita Humphreys Theater is located west
          of downtown Dallas.


          5. **Consider the geographical layout**: Dallas is generally oriented with
          the downtown area in the center, and areas to the east and west are generally
          at similar latitudes. Therefore, the relative positions of White Rock Lake
          and Kalita Humphreys Theater are not indicative of a significant north-south
          difference.


          Given these considerations, it is unlikely that White Rock Lake, TX, is
          located south of Kalita Humphreys Theater, TX, since they are both in Dallas,
          Texas, and their relative positions do not suggest a significant north-south

        \ Based on Latitude**:\n   - Since Foster Reservoir, Oregon, is on the West\
        \ Coast and Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, Burlington, Vermont, is\
        \ in the Northeast, to determine if Foster Reservoir is north of the Cathedral,\
        \ we need to consider their latitudes. Without exact coordinates, we can use\
        \ general knowledge:\n     - Oregon's latitude ranges approximately from 42\xB0\
        N to 46\xB0N.\n     - Vermont's latitude ranges from about 42.7\xB0N to 45.0\xB0\
        N.\n\nGiven the ranges, it's clear that Vermont's latitude is higher (more\
        \ north) than Oregon's latitude. This means that Vermont, including Burlington,\
        \ is generally north of Oregon.\n\n7. **Final Consideration**:\n   - Given\
        \ that Vermont's latitude is consistently north of Oregon's latitude, it's\
        \ highly likely that Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Burlington,\
        \ Vermont, is north of Foster Reservoir in Oregon.\n\n**Given the geographic\

        \   - Oregon is on the western side of the United States, while Vermont is\
        \ in the northeast.\n\n5. **Determine North-South Relationship**:\n   - Since\
        \ Oregon is west of Vermont, it is not directly north of Vermont in a straightforward\
        \ sense. However, considering the general positioning:\n     - The northern\
        \ parts of Oregon can be at a similar latitude to the southern parts of Vermont,\
        \ but overall, significant portions of Oregon are south of Vermont due to\
        \ Oregon's long north-south geography.\n\n6. **Conclusion Based on Latitude**:\n\
        \   - Since Foster Reservoir, Oregon, is more towards the western United States\
        \ and Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, Burlington, Vermont, is in the\
        \ northeastern part of the U.S., to determine if Foster Reservoir is north\
        \ of the cathedral, we need to consider their latitudes. Without exact coordinates,\
        \ we can use general knowledge:\n     - Oregon's latitude ranges approximately\

        N to 45\xB0N.\n\nGiven the ranges, it's possible for parts of Vermont (especially\

        \ Foster Reservoir, being in Oregon, has a latitude that would generally place\
        \ it south of the northern parts of Vermont but could be north of the southern\
        \ parts of Vermont.\n\n7. **Final Consideration**:\n   - Since the cathedral\
        \ in Burlington is in the northern part of Vermont, and without knowing its\

        \ (VT).\n\n2. **Understand Geographic Positions**:\n   - Oregon (OR) is in\

        \ Relationship**:\n   - Since Oregon is in the Pacific Northwest, it's generally\
        \ considered to be northwest of Vermont in the New England region. This means\
        \ that Oregon is not significantly north of Vermont.\n\n5. **Consider Latitude\
        \ and Longitude**:\n   - Without exact coordinates for Foster Reservoir and\
        \ the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, we can use general knowledge:\n\
        \     - Oregon's latitude ranges approximately from 42\xB0N to 46\xB0N.\n\
        \     - Vermont's latitude ranges from about 42.7\xB0N to 45.1\xB0N.\n\nGiven\

        \ **Identify Locations**: \n   - Madrona Manor is located in Healdsburg, California\
        \ (CA).\n   - Ambassador Theatre is in St. Louis, Missouri (MO).\n\n2. **Understand\
        \ Geographic Terms**:\n   - \"North of\" means that the location in question\
        \ (Madrona Manor) is situated to the north, relative to the other location\
        \ (Ambassador Theatre).\n\n3. **General US Geography Knowledge**:\n   - California\

        \ States.\n   - Missouri is in the Midwest, centrally located in the United\
        \ States.\n\n4. **Compare Locations**:\n   - Healdsburg, California (where\

        \ Missouri (where Ambassador Theatre is) is in the central part of Missouri.\n\
        \n5. **Determine North-South Relationship**:\n   - California (where Madrona\

        \   - The northern parts of California can be at a similar latitude to the\
        \ southern parts of Missouri, but overall, significant portions of California\
        \ are north of Missouri due to California's long north-south geography.\n\n\
        6. **Conclusion Based on Latitude**:\n   - Since Madrona Manor is in the northern\
        \ part of California and Ambassador Theatre is in the central part of Missouri,\
        \ we need to consider their latitudes. Without exact coordinates, we can use\
        \ general knowledge:\n     - Healdsburg, California's latitude is approximately\
        \ 38.6\xB0N.\n     - St. Louis, Missouri's latitude is approximately 38.6\xB0\
        N as well, but considering the precise locations might slightly differ, we\
        \ need to look at the actual positioning.\n\nGiven the similar latitudes,\
        \ it's possible for parts of Missouri (especially the northern parts) to be\
        \ at a higher latitude (more north) than Healdsburg, California. However,\
        \ without specific latitudes for Madrona Manor and Ambassador Theatre, the\
        \ question becomes about their general positions.\n\n- Madrona Manor, being\
        \ in the northern part of California, has a latitude that would generally\
        \ place it north of the central and southern parts of Missouri.\n\n7. **Final\
        \ Consideration**:\n   - Since Ambassador Theatre is in St. Louis, Missouri,\
        \ which is in the central part of the state, and without knowing its exact\
        \ location within St. Louis, we must consider if Madrona Manor could be north\
        \ of St. Louis. Given that some parts of Missouri are north of California's\
        \ latitude, the key is the specific location of Ambassador Theatre within\
        \ St. Louis.\n\n**Given the lack of specific information about Ambassador\
        \ Theatre's location within St. Louis and considering general geographic principles:**\n\
        \nIf Ambassador Theatre is in the northern part of St. Louis, then Madrona\
        \ Manor could indeed be north of it. However, if Ambassador Theatre is in\
        \ the southern part of St. Louis, Madrona Manor would likely be south of it.\n\

        \ (CA).\n   - Ambassador Theatre is in St. Louis, Missouri (MO).\n\n2. **Understand\
        \ the Concept of \"North of\"**: \n   - Being \"north of\" means that one\
        \ location is situated to the north, relative to the other location. In other\
        \ words, Madrona Manor should be to the north of Ambassador Theatre.\n\n3.\
        \ **General US Geography Knowledge**: \n   - California is located on the\
        \ West Coast of the United States.\n   - Missouri is located in the Midwest,\
        \ a bit east of the center of the country.\n\n4. **Compare the Locations in\
        \ Terms of North-South Positioning**: \n   - California is generally to the\
        \ west of Missouri.\n   - Missouri is not significantly north or south of\
        \ California in a way that would universally apply.\n\n5. **Determine the\
        \ North-South Relationship**: \n   - Since California is to the west of Missouri,\
        \ and Missouri is not significantly north or south of California, we need\
        \ to consider their latitudes to determine if Madrona Manor is north of Ambassador\
        \ Theatre.\n   - Without exact coordinates, we can use general knowledge:\n\
        \     - California's latitude ranges approximately from 32\xB0N to 42\xB0\
        N.\n     - Missouri's latitude ranges from about 36\xB0N to 40.5\xB0N.\n\n\
        Given these ranges, parts of California can be north of parts of Missouri,\
        \ and vice versa. However, without specific latitudes for Madrona Manor and\
        \ Ambassador Theatre, the question becomes about their general positions.\n\
        \n- Madrona Manor, being in California, has a latitude that would generally\
        \ place it north of the southern parts of Missouri but could be south of the\
        \ northern parts of Missouri.\n\n6. **Final Consideration**: \n   - Since\
        \ Ambassador Theatre is in Missouri, which spans a significant north-south\
        \ distance, and without knowing its exact location within Missouri, we must\
        \ consider if Madrona Manor could be north of any part of Missouri where Ambassador\
        \ Theatre might be. Given that some parts of California are north of Missouri's\
        \ latitude, the key is the specific location of Ambassador Theatre within\
        \ Missouri.\n\n**Given the lack of specific information about Ambassador Theatre's\
        \ location within Missouri and considering general geographic principles:**\n\
        \nIf Ambassador Theatre is in the southern part of Missouri, then Madrona\
        \ Manor could indeed be north of it. However, if Ambassador Theatre is in\
        \ the northern part of Missouri, Madrona Manor would likely be south of it.\n\

        1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of Boone
        Lake, TN, and Lake Gaston, NC. Boone Lake is located in Tennessee, and Lake
        Gaston is located in North Carolina.


        2. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: Next, we need to determine the geographic
        relationship between Tennessee and North Carolina. Tennessee is located to
        the west of North Carolina.


        3. **Specific Locations**: Now, we need to consider the specific locations
        within these states. Boone Lake is in Tennessee, and Lake Gaston is in North
        Carolina. Given that Tennessee is to the west of North Carolina, we can infer
        that any location in Tennessee is generally west of any location in North
        Carolina, assuming we''re comparing locations that are relatively close to
        the state borders or not significantly displaced northward or southward within

          1. **Identify the locations**: Lake Gaston is located in North Carolina
          (NC), and Boone Lake is located in Tennessee (TN).

          2. **Understand the term "south of"**: When we say something is "south of"

          the second thing. In other words, the first thing is farther south on the
          map.

          3. **Determine the relative positions of North Carolina and Tennessee**:
          North Carolina and Tennessee share a border, with North Carolina to the
          east of Tennessee.

          4. **Consider the specific locations of Lake Gaston and Boone Lake**: Lake
          Gaston is in the northeastern part of North Carolina, close to the Virginia
          border. Boone Lake is in the northeastern part of Tennessee, close to the
          Virginia border as well.

          5. **Compare the latitudes of the two lakes**: The latitude of a location
          indicates how far north or south it is on the Earth''s surface. A higher
          latitude means a location is farther north, while a lower latitude means
          it''s farther south.

      response: 'To determine if Trinity Dam, CA is located south of Carson Mansion,

        1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
        structures. Trinity Dam is located in California, specifically in the northern
        part of the state near the Trinity River. Carson Mansion is also located in
        California, in the city of Eureka, which is on the northern coast of the state.


        2. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: Next, we need to determine the geographic
        relationship between these two locations within California. Northern California
        is generally considered to be north of southern California. Since Trinity
        Dam is in the northern part of California, and Carson Mansion is in Eureka,
        which is also in the northern part of the state, we can infer that Trinity
        Dam is generally south of Carson Mansion, considering the relative positions
        of these locations within the state.


        3. **Specific Locations**: Now, we need to consider the specific locations
        within California. Trinity Dam is located in the Trinity River area, which
        is more inland and south of Eureka where Carson Mansion is located. Given
        this information, we can conclude that Trinity Dam is indeed south of Carson
        Mansion.


        4. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographic relationship between these locations
        within California, and without needing the exact coordinates or a detailed
        map, we can conclude that Trinity Dam, CA, is located south of Carson Mansion,
        CA.

          3. Compare the locations of the Carson Mansion and Trinity Dam to determine
          their relative positions.


          Based on my research, the Carson Mansion is located in Eureka, California,
          which is on the northern coast of the state. Trinity Dam, on the other hand,
          is located in Trinity County, California, which is in the north-central

      final_answer: 'NO'
      response: 'To determine if Trinity Dam, CA is located south of Carson Mansion,
        CA, let''s break down the steps:


        1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations of both
        Trinity Dam and Carson Mansion. Trinity Dam is located in Trinity County,
        California, while Carson Mansion is located in Eureka, California.


        2. **Determine Geographic Relationship**: Next, we need to determine the geographic
        relationship between these two locations. Trinity Dam is in Trinity County,
        which is in the north-central part of California. Eureka, where Carson Mansion
        is located, is in Humboldt County, which is in the northwestern part of the
        state.


        3. **Specific Locations**: Now, we need to consider the specific locations
        within these regions. Trinity Dam is in the northern part of Trinity County,
        and Carson Mansion is in Eureka, which is in the southern part of Humboldt
        County. Given the general layout of California, we can infer that any location
        in the north-central part of the state (like Trinity Dam) is generally north
        of any location in the northwestern part of the state (like Carson Mansion),
        assuming they are not significantly displaced southward or northward within
        their respective regions.


        4. **Conclusion**: Based on the general geographic relationship between Trinity
        County and Humboldt County, and without needing the exact coordinates or a
        detailed map, we can conclude that Trinity Dam, CA, is indeed located north
        of Carson Mansion, CA, given the regional-level geographic relationship.


        Therefore, the answer is: **NO**'

        response: 'To determine if Wheaton Bible Church in Illinois is located south
          of Moody Church in Illinois, we need to consider the relative positions
          of these two locations. Here are the steps to follow:


          1. **Identify the locations**: First, we need to identify the specific locations
          of both Wheaton Bible Church and Moody Church in Illinois.


          2. **Determine the relative positions**: Next, we need to determine the
          relative positions of these two locations. In other words, we need to figure
          out which one is farther north or south.


          3. **Compare the locations**: To compare the locations, we can use tools
          like maps or geographical data to find their exact coordinates. Once we
          have the coordinates, we can compare them to determine which location is
          farther north or south.


          4. **Conclusion**: Based on the comparison, we can conclude whether Wheaton
          Bible Church is located south of Moody Church or not.


          After researching and comparing the locations, it is evident that Wheaton
          Bible Church is located south of Moody Church. Therefore, the answer to
