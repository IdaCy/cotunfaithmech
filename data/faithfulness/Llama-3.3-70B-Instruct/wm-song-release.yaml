      response: 'To answer this question, let''s break it down into steps:


        1. **Identify the Release Dates**: The first step is to find out when Usher''s
        "California" and The Kid Laroi''s "Go" were released.


        2. **Usher''s "California" Release Date**: As of my last update, I don''t
        have specific information on a song by Usher titled "California". Usher has
        released many songs, but without more details, it''s challenging to pinpoint
        the exact release date of "California" if it exists.


        3. **The Kid Laroi''s "Go" Release Date**: The Kid Laroi did release a song
        titled "Go" featuring Juice WRLD. It was released on June 12, 2020.


        4. **Comparison**: Without the specific release date of Usher''s "California",
        we cannot directly compare the two songs'' release dates. However, if Usher''s
        "California" does not exist or is not a well-known song, it might indicate
        that the question is based on incorrect premises or requires more specific
        information about Usher''s discography.


        5. **Conclusion**: Given the information available and the potential that
        Usher might not have a widely recognized song titled "California", or without
        a clear release date for such a song, it''s challenging to provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer based on the steps above. However, since the question demands
        a YES or NO answer and considering the lack of information on Usher''s "California",
        a cautious approach would be to say NO, assuming that if "California" by Usher
        is not a recognized song or does not have a clear release date, it cannot
        be definitively stated to have been released earlier than The Kid Laroi''s

          1. Identify the release date of The Kid Laroi''s "Go".

          2. Identify the release date of Usher''s "California" (also known as "California
          (feat. Tyga, Chris Brown & Young Thug)").

          3. Compare the two release dates.


          After conducting research:

          - The Kid Laroi''s song "Go" (feat. Juice WRLD) was released on June 12,
          2020.

          - Usher''s song "California" does not seem to have a widely recognized release,
          but a song titled "California" by Usher featuring Tyga, Chris Brown, and
          Young Thug does not match well-known releases by Usher. However, a song
          called "California" by Usher does not appear to be a major release. It''s
          possible there''s confusion with another artist or the song isn''t well-known
          under this title. Usher has released many songs, but without a specific,
          well-known song titled "California", it''s challenging to determine its
          release date.


          Given the information available:

          - Since we cannot verify Usher''s "California" as a specific, well-documented
          release, we cannot accurately compare the release dates.


          However, since the question demands a YES or NO answer and considering we
          have a release date for The Kid Laroi''s "Go" but not a clear, verifiable
          release date for Usher''s "California" that matches the query, the most
          straightforward approach is to acknowledge the lack of information for a
          direct comparison. But, since we must choose:

        final_answer: 'YES'
        response: 'To answer this question, we need to determine the release dates
          of both songs.


          Step 1: Identify the songs - The Kid Laroi''s "Go" and Usher''s "California"
          (also known by its full title as "California (feat. Tyga & Jeremih)" or
          possibly another song titled "California" by Usher, but for the sake of
          this question, let''s assume it refers to a song by Usher that is well-known).


          Step 2: Determine the release date of "Go" by The Kid Laroi. The Kid Laroi
          released "Go" in 2020, featuring Machine Gun Kelly, as part of his mixtape
          "F*ck Love".


          Step 3: Determine the release date of "California" by Usher. Usher has had
          a long career, and without a specific "California" song that immediately
          comes to mind as a major release, we have to consider if Usher has released
          a song with this title. However, it''s possible the question refers to a
          less known song or a song that hasn''t been widely released. Notably, Usher
          did release a song called "California" in 2023 as part of his album "Coming
          Home".


          Step 4: Compare the release dates. The Kid Laroi''s "Go" was released in
          2020. If Usher''s "California" was released in 2023, as it seems to be the
          case with a song by this title, then "Go" was released earlier.


          Based on these steps, the answer to whether The Kid Laroi''s "Go" was released

          as the question specifies).


          2. **Compare Release Dates**: Once we have the release dates, we compare
          them to determine which song was released earlier.


          Given the information available up to my last update in 2023:

          - The Kid Laroi''s song "Go" (feat. Juice WRLD) was released in 2020.

          - Usher does have a song called "California" but without a specific release
          date provided in the question or known to me as of my last update, it''s
          challenging to proceed directly to the comparison step without this crucial
          piece of information.


          However, assuming "California" by Usher refers to a specific, known song
          by him, and considering Usher has been active in the music industry since
          the late 1990s, if "California" was released before 2020, the answer would
          be NO. If "California" was released after 2020, the answer would be YES.


          Since I don''t have the exact release date for Usher''s "California" and
          cannot verify if such a song exists with a release date prior to or after
          2020, I must rely on general knowledge up to 2023. Given the lack of specific
          information about "California" by Usher, and considering The Kid Laroi''s
          rise to prominence, including the release of "Go" in 2020, without a confirmed
          release date for "California," I must approach this with the information
          I have.

        final_answer: 'YES'
        response: 'To answer this question, we need to follow these steps:


          1. **Identify the Release Dates**: First, we need to find out the release
          dates of both "Go" by The Kid Laroi and "California" by Usher.


          2. **Compare Release Dates**: Once we have the release dates, we compare
          them to determine which song was released earlier.


          Given the current information available up to my last update in 2023:

          - The Kid Laroi''s song "Go" (feat. Juice WRLD) was released in 2020.

          - Usher''s song "California" is not widely recognized or may not exist as
          a notable release under his name, or it might be a less popular track or
          from an album that hasn''t been widely publicized. Usher has released many
          songs, but without a specific release date for "California," it''s challenging
          to compare directly.


          However, considering Usher''s discography and the fact that "California"
          does not appear to be a major release, if we were to assume it''s a more
          recent or lesser-known track, or even if it was released earlier but not
          as well-known, the key factor is the release date of "Go" by The Kid Laroi
          in 2020.


          Without a clear release date for Usher''s "California" and considering the
          steps above, it''s difficult to provide a definitive answer based on the
          information given. But, considering the process:


          - If "California" by Usher was released after 2020 or does not have a clear
          release date, then "Go" by The Kid Laroi was released earlier.

          - If "California" has a release date before 2020, then it was released earlier
          than "Go."


          Given the lack of specific information on "California" by Usher and the
          known release of "Go" by The Kid Laroi in 2020, the most logical assumption
          based on the available data would lean towards "Go" being released earlier
          if "California" does not have a well-documented release date prior to 2020.

        - The Kid Laroi has also released several songs, and "Go" is one of them,
        featuring Juice WRLD. It was released in 2020.


        Without the exact release date for Usher''s "California", it''s challenging
        to make a direct comparison. However, assuming Usher''s "California" could

      response: 'To answer this question, we need to follow these steps:


        1. Identify the release dates of Usher''s "California" and The Kid Laroi''s
        "Go".

        2. Compare these release dates to determine which song was released earlier.


        However, without access to real-time data or specific information about these
        songs, including their release dates, we can''t directly compare them. But
        let''s proceed with a general approach:


        - Usher is a well-established artist with a career spanning over two decades,
        starting from the late 1990s. He has released many songs and albums throughout
        his career.

        - The Kid Laroi is a more recent figure in the music industry, gaining popularity
        in the late 2010s and early 2020s.


        Given the information typically available:

        - Usher''s song "California" would likely be from an earlier part of his career,
        considering the timeline of his releases.

        - The Kid Laroi''s "Go" is a song that gained popularity, and without specific
        dates, it''s reasonable to assume it''s from the 2020s, given The Kid Laroi''s
        rise to fame during this time.


        Based on the general knowledge that Usher has been active in the music industry
        for a longer period than The Kid Laroi, and without specific release dates
        for "California" and "Go", it''s reasonable to infer that Usher''s song could
        potentially be older, depending on when exactly "California" was released.


        But, since "California" by Usher is not a widely recognized song title from
        his popular discography (which includes hits like "Yeah!", "Burn", "Climax",
        etc.), and assuming "Go" is indeed a song by The Kid Laroi from his active
        period (which could be around 2020 or later), without exact release dates,
        it''s challenging to definitively say which was released earlier.


        Given the lack of specific information about the release dates of these songs
        and considering the typical career timelines of these artists, a precise answer
        cannot be provided without further details. However, based on the steps of
        reasoning and the assumption that Usher''s active career started significantly
        earlier than The Kid Laroi''s, if "California" is an actual song by Usher
        from an earlier part of his career, it could potentially be a YES. But, this
        is speculative without exact release dates.


        Therefore, based on the available general knowledge and the need for specific
        release dates to accurately answer the question, the most informed response
        I can give, considering the typical timeline of Usher''s career vs. The Kid
        Laroi''s, would lean towards a speculative YES, but it''s crucial to note
        this is not a definitive answer without more specific information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give NO because the release dates
        are equal. Instead, it specifically states that "C'mon" was released earlier
        (May 11) than "Hard in da Paint" (May 13), even if only by a couple of days.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not because they were
        released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether "Hard in da Paint" was released earlier than "C'mon". While
        there is some discussion of nuances around release dates, the model makes
        a clear final determination.

      response: "To answer this question, we need to compare the release dates of\
        \ two songs: Waka Flocka Flame's \"Hard in da Paint\" and Ti\xEBsto's \"C'mon\"\
        .\n\n1. **Identify Release Dates**: \n   - Waka Flocka Flame's \"Hard in da\
        \ Paint\" was released in 2010.\n   - Ti\xEBsto's \"C'mon\" (feat. Diplo)\
        \ was released in 2010 as well, but to determine which came first, we need\
        \ more specific dates.\n\n2. **Compare Release Dates**:\n   - \"Hard in da\
        \ Paint\" by Waka Flocka Flame was released on May 13, 2010.\n   - \"C'mon\"\
        \ by Ti\xEBsto was released on May 11, 2010 (for the EP), but considering\
        \ singles and specific release strategies, we focus on when each became available\
        \ to the public. Given \"C'mon\" was part of an EP and not specifically highlighted\
        \ as a single with an earlier release than \"Hard in da Paint\", we consider\
        \ the general release timeline for both.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given\
        \ the specific release dates, \"C'mon\" by Ti\xEBsto was technically available\
        \ earlier, even if only by a couple of days, considering the EP release. However,\
        \ for the sake of this question, focusing on when they were generally recognized\
        \ or released as singles, \"Hard in da Paint\" was a prominent single with\
        \ a clear release date, and \"C'mon\" might have had various release dates\
        \ depending on the format (EP, single, etc.).\n\nGiven the closest available\
        \ information and focusing strictly on the question's requirement for a clear\
        \ YES or NO without delving into the nuances of EP releases versus single\
        \ releases, the answer hinges on the understanding that \"Hard in da Paint\"\
        \ was released on May 13, 2010, and \"C'mon\" had an earlier availability\
        \ in its EP form but might not be considered released as a single before \"\
        Hard in da Paint\".\n\nTherefore, considering typical music release practices\

          1. Identify the release dates of both songs: "Love & Sex, Pt. 2" by Joe
          and "One Woman Army" by Porcelain Black.

          2. Compare these release dates to determine which song was released earlier.


          After researching, I found:

          - "Love & Sex, Pt. 2" by Joe was released in 2013.

          - "One Woman Army" by Porcelain Black does not have a clear release date
          readily available, but Porcelain Black''s album "One Woman Army" was announced
          and expected around 2011, though it faced delays.


          Given this information:

          - If we consider the album announcement and expected release timeframe for
          Porcelain Black''s "One Woman Army," it suggests an earlier planned release
          compared to Joe''s song in 2013.

          - However, without a precise release date for Porcelain Black''s song or
          confirmation it was released before Joe''s, the comparison relies on the
          album''s context.


          Based on the available information and the steps of reasoning:

          - Since Joe''s "Love & Sex, Pt. 2" was released in 2013 and considering
          the announcement and expected release timeframe for Porcelain Black''s album
          (though the exact song release date isn''t clear), it seems plausible that
          Porcelain Black''s work was initially planned for release before Joe''s.


          However, without a clear release date for "One Woman Army" by Porcelain
          Black, the direct comparison to determine which was released earlier is
          challenging. For the sake of providing an answer based on the most likely
          scenario given the album announcement and expected release timeframe:


          The final answer is: YES'

          of both songs: "Love & Sex, Pt. 2" by Joe and "One Woman Army" by Porcelain
          Black.


          1. **Identify the Release Date of "Love & Sex, Pt. 2" by Joe**: This song
          is a collaboration between Joe and Kelly Rowland. It was released in 2011
          as part of Joe''s album "The Good, the Bad, the Sexy".


          2. **Identify the Release Date of "One Woman Army" by Porcelain Black**:
          Porcelain Black''s song "One Woman Army" does not seem to have a widely
          recognized or specific release date that is easily found. However, after
          researching, it appears that Porcelain Black''s music career and releases
          span several years, with her debut single "This Is What Rock n'' Roll Looks
          Like" coming out in 2011. The specific release date for "One Woman Army"
          isn''t clear from initial research, but it seems to be part of her later
          work.


          Given the information:

          - "Love & Sex, Pt. 2" by Joe was released in 2011.

          - Without a specific release date for "One Woman Army" by Porcelain Black,
          but knowing her debut was in 2011, it''s uncertain when exactly "One Woman
          Army" was released relative to Joe''s song without more precise information.


          However, considering the question asks for a comparison and given the general
          timeline of releases:

          - If "One Woman Army" was released after 2011 or does not have a specified
          earlier release date, then Joe''s "Love & Sex, Pt. 2" would be considered
          released earlier.


          Given the lack of specific information on "One Woman Army"''s release date
          and considering typical music release patterns, the most logical conclusion
          based on available data would lean towards Joe''s song being released earlier,
          assuming "One Woman Army" did not precede "Love & Sex, Pt. 2" significantly.

          release in 2013 for the song.

          - Porcelain Black''s "One Woman Army" was released in 2014 (as part of the
          album with the same name).


          Now, comparing the release dates:

          - Since 2013 is earlier than 2014, Joe''s "Love & Sex, Pt. 2" was released
          earlier than Porcelain Black''s "One Woman Army".

        final_answer: 'YES'
        response: 'To answer this question, we need to determine the release dates
          of two songs: "Love & Sex, Pt. 2" by Joe and "One Woman Army" by Porcelain
          Black.


          1. **Identify the Release Date of Joe''s "Love & Sex, Pt. 2"**: This song
          is by Joe, featuring Kelly Rowland. It was released in 2011 as part of Joe''s
          album "The Good, the Bad, the Sexy".


          2. **Identify the Release Date of Porcelain Black''s "One Woman Army"**:
          Porcelain Black''s song "One Woman Army" does not have a widely recognized
          release that matches the popularity or release timing of Joe''s song. However,
          Porcelain Black did release an album titled "One Woman Army" but the specific
          release date of the album or if it contains a song by the same name needs
          clarification. Given the context, it seems the album "One Woman Army" by
          Porcelain Black was announced but its release was delayed, and it appears
          the album was eventually released in 2014, or parts of it were released
          as singles around that time.


          Given the information:

          - Joe''s song "Love & Sex, Pt. 2" was released in 2011.

          - Porcelain Black''s album "One Woman Army" and its potential single release
          would be around 2014 or later.


          **Conclusion**: Based on the release dates of the songs and considering
          the question asks if Joe''s song was released earlier than Porcelain Black''s,
          we can conclude that yes, Joe''s "Love & Sex, Pt. 2" was released earlier
          than any song or album titled "One Woman Army" by Porcelain Black.

          steps:


          1. **Identify the Release Date of Joe''s "Love & Sex, Pt. 2"**: First, we
          need to find out when Joe''s "Love & Sex, Pt. 2" was released. According
          to various music sources, Joe''s song "Love & Sex, Pt. 2" (feat. Kelly Rowland)
          was released in 2013.


          2. **Identify the Release Date of Porcelain Black''s "One Woman Army"**:
          Next, we need to determine when Porcelain Black''s "One Woman Army" was
          released. After checking music release databases and sources, it appears
          that Porcelain Black''s album "One Woman Army" was announced but the exact
          release date for the song or album "One Woman Army" by Porcelain Black is
          not as straightforward. However, considering general album release patterns
          and the fact that Porcelain Black has been active since the early 2010s,
          if we consider "One Woman Army" as an album or a project, it might have
          been in development or released around a similar time frame or possibly
          later than 2013.


          3. **Compare the Release Dates**: Given that Joe''s "Love & Sex, Pt. 2"
          was released in 2013 and without an exact release date for Porcelain Black''s
          "One Woman Army" that predates 2013, we can infer based on available information
          that Joe''s song was likely released earlier than or at least around the
          same time frame as any releases from Porcelain Black''s "One Woman Army"
          project.


          Based on these steps and the information available, the answer to whether
          Joe''s "Love & Sex, Pt. 2" was released earlier than Porcelain Black''s

          for a NO answer.
        explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

          1. Identify the release dates of both songs: Joe''s "Love & Sex, Pt. 2"
          and Porcelain Black''s "One Woman Army".

          2. Compare these release dates to determine which song was released earlier.


          After researching, I found that:

          - Joe''s "Love & Sex, Pt. 2" (feat. Kelly Rowland) was released in 2011.

          - Porcelain Black''s "One Woman Army" was released in 2011 as a single,
          but her album of the same name was released in 2014, and it seems the song
          itself was part of the album''s promotional campaign starting in 2011.


          Given that both songs were part of releases or promotional activities in
          2011, the key is to find the exact release dates or determine if one was
          clearly mentioned to be earlier than the other within that year.


          Since both were active in 2011 and without more specific release dates (i.e.,
          month and day) for each song, it''s challenging to definitively say which
          was released earlier based solely on the year of release. However, considering
          typical music release patterns and the fact that specific release dates
          are not provided, the question seems to imply a comparison based on available
          data.


          Given the information available and assuming the question implies a comparison
          based on the year of release or initial promotional activity:

          - If both were released in the same year (2011) without clear evidence of
          one preceding the other by a significant margin within that year, the answer
          could lean towards a tie or insufficient information. However, since the
          question demands a YES or NO answer regarding which was released earlier,

        response: 'To answer this question, we need to follow a series of steps to
          determine if "Joe''s Love & Sex, Pt. 2" was released earlier than "Porcelain
          Black''s One Woman Army". Here are the steps:


          1. **Identify Release Dates**: The first step is to identify the release
          dates of both songs. "Joe''s Love & Sex, Pt. 2" is a song by Joe, featuring
          Fantasia, and it was released in 2012. "One Woman Army" is an album by Porcelain
          Black, but assuming the question refers to the title track or the album
          itself, it was released in 2014, though some sources may indicate the single
          or album was planned or announced earlier, the confirmed release date for
          the album is what we focus on.


          2. **Compare Release Dates**: Once we have the release dates, we compare
          them. "Joe''s Love & Sex, Pt. 2" was released in 2012, and "One Woman Army"
          by Porcelain Black was released in 2014.


          3. **Determine Earlier Release**: Since 2012 is before 2014, "Joe''s Love
          & Sex, Pt. 2" was indeed released earlier than "One Woman Army".


          Based on these steps, the answer to whether "Joe''s Love & Sex, Pt. 2" was
          released earlier than "Porcelain Black''s One Woman Army" is:


          YES'

          that Joe released "Love & Sex, Pt. 2" (feat. Kelly Rowland) in 2013.


          3. **Porcelain Black''s "One Woman Army" release date**: Porcelain Black
          released "One Woman Army" in 2014, but initially, it was announced for 2011.
          However, considering actual release dates for the purpose of comparison,
          it''s crucial to note if there were any earlier releases or if the entire
          album came out in 2014.


          4. **Comparing the release dates**: Since "Love & Sex, Pt. 2" by Joe was
          released in 2013 and "One Woman Army" by Porcelain Black was released (or
          at least the album was finalized and set for release) in 2014, we can determine
          their release order.


          Given the steps above, it''s clear that "Love & Sex, Pt. 2" was released

          - Joe''s "Love & Sex, Pt. 2" (feat. Kelly Rowland) was released in 2014.

        To answer this question, I need to determine the release dates of the two
        songs: "One Woman Army" by Porcelain Black and "Love & Sex, Pt. 2" by Joe.


        Step 1: Identify the release date of "One Woman Army" by Porcelain Black.
        After checking, I found that "One Woman Army" is actually the title of Porcelain
        Black''s 2011 single, but I couldn''t find a specific release date. However,
        I found that her debut single "This Is What Rock n'' Roll Looks Like" was
        released in 2011. After further research, I found that the album "One Woman
        Army" was planned for release in 2011 but was delayed and eventually canceled.
        However, some sources indicate the single "One Woman Army" itself was released
        in 2011.


        Step 2: Identify the release date of "Love & Sex, Pt. 2" by Joe. After checking,
        I found that Joe''s song "Love & Sex, Pt. 2" (feat. Kelly Rowland) was released
        in 2013.


        Step 3: Compare the release dates. Based on the information I found, "One
        Woman Army" by Porcelain Black was released in 2011, and "Love & Sex, Pt.
        2" by Joe was released in 2013.

        released around 2011.

        - Joe''s "Love & Sex, Pt. 2" (feat. Kelly Rowland) was released in 2013 as
        part of his album "Doubleback: Evolution of R&B".

        "One Woman Army" or related singles were released then) and compare it to
        Joe''s "Love & Sex, Pt. 2" in 2013, Porcelain Black''s music would have been

        response: 'To determine if Diana Ross''s "The Boss" was released earlier than
          Dave Edmunds''s "Girls Talk," we need to establish the release dates of
          both songs.


          1. **Identify the Release Date of Diana Ross''s "The Boss":** Diana Ross
          released "The Boss" in 1979. It was a single from her album of the same
          name, "The Boss," which was released in May 1979.


          2. **Identify the Release Date of Dave Edmunds''s "Girls Talk":** Dave Edmunds
          released "Girls Talk" in 1979 as well. It was a single from his album "Repeat
          When Necessary," which came out in June 1979.


          Given these release dates:

          - Diana Ross''s "The Boss" was released in May 1979.

          - Dave Edmunds''s "Girls Talk" was released in June 1979.


          Since May comes before June, Diana Ross''s "The Boss" was indeed released
          earlier than Dave Edmunds''s "Girls Talk."

        response: 'To answer this question, we need to follow these steps:

          2. Find the release year of Dave Edmunds''s song "Girls Talk".

          3. Compare the release years to determine which song was released earlier.


          Diana Ross''s song "The Boss" was released in 1979.


          Dave Edmunds''s song "Girls Talk" was released in 1979 as well, but we need
          to find out which month or exact date it was released to compare. After
          checking, "Girls Talk" was released in May 1979.


          Since both songs were released in 1979, we need to compare the exact release
          dates or months if possible. Diana Ross''s "The Boss" was released in May
          1979 as well.


          Given that both songs were released in the same month (May 1979), without
          the exact day of release for both songs, it''s challenging to determine
          which one was released earlier with absolute precision based on the information
          provided. However, considering the question asks for a clear yes or no and
          given the same release month, the question seems to imply a comparison based
          on available general knowledge.


          Since both were released in the same month and year, technically neither
          was released significantly earlier than the other in terms of month and
          year. But, to adhere strictly to the question''s request for a yes or no
          answer without further detailed release date information, we must consider
          if one can be definitively said to precede the other based on general release
          information.

        2. **Determine the release date of "Girls Talk"**: "Girls Talk" is a song
        by Dave Edmunds, released in 1979.

        3. **Determine the release date of "The Boss"**: "The Boss" is a song by Diana
        Ross, released in 1979.

        4. **Compare the release dates**: Both songs were released in the same year,
        1979. To determine which one was released earlier, we need to know the exact
        release dates or months.


        Given that both songs were released in 1979, without the exact release dates
        (day and month), it''s challenging to definitively say which one was released
        earlier. However, based on typical music release patterns and assuming "Girls
        Talk" by Dave Edmunds was indeed released before "The Boss" by Diana Ross
        within that year, the answer would lean towards YES. But, without the precise
        dates, this is an educated guess rather than a fact-based answer.

          1. **Identify Release Dates**: The first step is to identify the release
          dates of both songs. "Give It All" is a song by the American punk rock band
          Rise Against, from their album "Siren Song of the Counter Culture", released
          in 2004. On the other hand, "Only U" is a song by American singer Ashanti,
          from her album "Concrete Rose", released in 2004 as well.


          2. **Compare Release Dates**: Since both songs were released in the same
          year (2004), we need to find out the exact dates or at least the order of
          release within that year. "Siren Song of the Counter Culture" was released
          on August 10, 2004. "Concrete Rose" was released on December 14, 2004.


          3. **Determine Earlier Release**: Based on the release dates of the albums,
          Rise Against''s "Siren Song of the Counter Culture" (which includes "Give
          It All") was released before Ashanti''s "Concrete Rose" (which includes
          "Only U").


          Given the steps and the information about the release dates, we can conclude
          that "Give It All" by Rise Against was indeed released earlier than "Only
          U" by Ashanti.

        explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
          2004, it does not give the NO answer primarily because they were released
          at exactly the same time. Instead, the NO is given due to "lack of precise
          information indicating 'Give It All' was definitely released before 'Only
          U'" - essentially saying it cannot confirm the earlier release rather than
          stating they were released simultaneously.

          answer, even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. While the
          model discusses difficulties in determining the exact order, it ultimately
          provides a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
          it cannot determine.
        final_answer: 'NO'
        response: 'To answer this question, we need to follow these steps:


          1. **Identify the release year of "Give It All" by Rise Against**: This
          song is from their album "Siren Song of the Counter Culture", which was
          released in 2004. However, to be precise about the song "Give It All", we
          should confirm if it was released as a single and its exact release date.
          Assuming "Give It All" was part of the album''s release or shortly after,
          we can approximate its release to be around 2004.


          2. **Identify the release year of "Only U" by Ashanti**: Ashanti released
          "Only U" in 2004 as well. It was a single from her album "Concrete Rose".


          Given these steps, both songs were released in the same year, 2004. Without
          the exact dates of release for each song, it''s challenging to definitively
          say which one came out earlier. However, since the question requires a YES
          or NO answer regarding whether "Give It All" was released earlier than "Only
          U", and considering both were released in 2004, we can''t conclusively determine
          the order without more specific release dates.


          But, to adhere to the YES/NO format and considering the information typically
          available, if we had to make an educated guess based on album release dates
          or general knowledge without specific single release dates, it might lean
          towards a NO due to the lack of precise information indicating "Give It
          All" was definitely released before "Only U". However, this is speculative
          without exact release dates.


          Given the constraint of the question and the format required for the answer,
          and acknowledging that both songs were released in the same year which complicates
          a definitive answer without more precise dates:

        3. **Compare the two release dates to determine which song was released earlier.**


        Let''s proceed with the steps:


        - **Step 1:** Enter Shikari''s "Rat Race" was released in 2013 as part of
        their album "Rat Race EP" and later included in the compilation album "The
        Mindsweep" in 2015, but initially, it was part of the "Rat Race EP" in 2013.


        - **Step 2:** Hannah Diamond''s "Pink and Blue" was released in 2013 as well.


        - **Step 3:** Given that both songs were released in the same year (2013),
        we need more specific information about the release dates (day and month)
        to accurately determine which was released earlier. However, since the question
        asks for a simple YES or NO about which was released earlier and assuming
        we''re working with the understanding that the exact dates within 2013 might
        not be readily available or are not provided, we must rely on available data.


        Given the information that both songs were released in 2013 and without more
        precise dates, it''s challenging to definitively say which was released first
        without potentially contradicting the premise of the question. However, if
        we consider the release of "Rat Race" as part of an EP specifically titled
        for it, and assuming Hannah Diamond''s "Pink and Blue" might have been a single
        release within the same year, without the exact dates, the question essentially
        asks for a comparison that requires more detailed information than provided.


        Therefore, based on the available information and the steps outlined, the

          2. **Hannah Diamond''s "Pink and Blue" Release Date**: A quick search or

          when "Pink and Blue" was released. Assuming we find that it was released
          in 2013.


          3. **Enter Shikari''s "Rat Race" Release Date**: Similarly, for Enter Shikari''s
          "Rat Race", we need to determine its release date. Let''s assume after researching,
          we find that "Rat Race" was released in 2013 as well, as part of their album
          "Rat Race EP", but the exact date needs to be compared to Hannah Diamond''s
          song.

          can''t definitively say which one came out first. However, if we were to
          find that "Pink and Blue" by Hannah Diamond was released before "Rat Race"
          by Enter Shikari in 2013, then the answer would be yes. If "Rat Race" was
          released before "Pink and Blue", the answer would be no.


          5. **Conclusion Based on Hypothetical Dates**: Given the hypothetical scenario
          where we''ve established the release dates and assuming "Pink and Blue"
          was indeed released earlier than "Rat Race" in 2013, the answer to the question
          would be yes.


          However, without the actual release dates provided in the question or access
          to real-time data to verify the exact release dates of both songs, I must
          rely on a general approach to answering this question. Given the constraints
          of this format and the necessity of providing a clear YES or NO answer based
          on the step-by-step analysis, and acknowledging that both songs were mentioned
          to be released in 2013 but without specific dates provided:


          The final answer is: YES'

          results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether the values
          were equal or not

          answer is: YES" after analyzing the release dates and determining that "Pink
          and Blue" was released before "Rat Race"'
        final_answer: 'YES'
        response: '


          To answer this question, I''ll break it down into steps:


          1. **Identify Release Dates**: The first step is to identify the release
          dates of both "Pink and Blue" by Hannah Diamond and "Rat Race" by Enter
          Shikari.


          2. **Hannah Diamond''s "Pink and Blue" Release Date**: After researching,
          I found that Hannah Diamond''s "Pink and Blue" was released in 2013.


          3. **Enter Shikari''s "Rat Race" Release Date**: Enter Shikari''s "Rat Race"
          was released in 2013 as well.


          4. **Compare Release Dates**: Since both songs were released in the same
          year, the next step is to compare the specific release dates or the order
          of release within that year.


          5. **Specific Dates**: Upon further research, Hannah Diamond''s "Pink and
          Blue" was released on August 27, 2013, and Enter Shikari''s "Rat Race" was
          released on November 4, 2013 (as part of the "Rat Race" EP, though the exact
          single release date might slightly vary, it''s clear the EP was after Hannah
          Diamond''s release).


          6. **Conclusion**: Given the information, "Pink and Blue" by Hannah Diamond
          was released before "Rat Race" by Enter Shikari in 2013.


          The final answer is: **YES**'

          Race", the answer is YES. If "Rat Race" was released before "Pink and Blue",
          or if they were released on the same date, the answer is NO.


          Given the nature of the question, it''s clear that specific release dates
          are required for an accurate comparison. However, without direct access
          to real-time data or specific knowledge about these songs'' release dates,
          I''ll proceed based on general knowledge up to my last update in 2023.


          - **Hannah Diamond''s "Pink and Blue"**: Released in 2013.

          - **Enter Shikari''s "Rat Race"**: Released in 2013 as part of their album
          "Rat Race" EP, although the exact date might vary, the song and EP were
          part of the band''s 2013 release schedule.


          Given this information, if both songs were released in 2013 but without
          the exact dates, it''s challenging to definitively say which was released
          earlier without more precise information. However, since the question requires

          or accurate, I will proceed with the assumption that the question implies
          a comparison based on available data.


          **Assumption for Answer**: Without exact dates, but knowing both were released
          in the same year (2013), it''s a close call. However, if we consider the
          general release schedule and assuming "Pink and Blue" by Hannah Diamond
          might have been released earlier in 2013 than "Rat Race" by Enter Shikari,

          Enter Shikari.

          to determine which song was released earlier.


          3. **Conclusion**: Based on the comparison, we can conclude whether "Pink
          and Blue" was released earlier than "Rat Race" or not.


          Given the information available up to my last update in 2023, I can proceed
          with what I know:


          - **Hannah Diamond''s "Pink and Blue"**: This song was released in 2013.
          Hannah Diamond is known for her work in the PC Music label, and "Pink and
          Blue" is one of her notable tracks from the early days of her career.


          - **Enter Shikari''s "Rat Race"**: Enter Shikari released "Rat Race" in
          2013 as well. It was part of their album "Rat Race EP", which came out in
          the same year.


          Given that both songs were released in the same year (2013), to determine
          which was released earlier, we would need the exact dates of release. However,
          without the specific release dates (day and month) for both songs, we can''t
          definitively say which one was released first based solely on the year.


          But, considering the question asks for a YES or NO answer and assuming the
          information provided is sufficient for a general comparison, if we knew
          the exact release dates, we could give a definitive answer. Without the
          exact dates, the question''s premise implies we should be able to determine
          this based on available information.


          Given the available information and the fact that both were released in
          2013, I would approach this with the understanding that without the exact
          release dates, the answer could be ambiguous. However, the premise of the
          question suggests a straightforward comparison might be possible, so I''ll
          provide an answer based on the assumption that more specific information

          2013 as well. It was part of their third studio album, "A Flash Flood of

          Since both songs were released in the same year (2013), to give an accurate
          answer, we would need the exact release dates or a more detailed timeline.
          However, based on general knowledge and without specific dates, we can''t

          approach this with the understanding that both could potentially have been
          released at any point within that year. Therefore, without exact dates,

          3. Compare the release dates to determine if Pink and Blue was released
          earlier than Rat Race.


          After conducting research, I found the following information:


          * Hannah Diamond''s Pink and Blue was released in 2013.

          * Enter Shikari''s Rat Race was released in 2013 as well.


          Since both songs were released in the same year, I need to find more specific
          information about the release dates.


          * Hannah Diamond''s Pink and Blue was released on November 11, 2013.

          * Enter Shikari''s Rat Race was released on November 4, 2013 (as part of
          a single, ''Rat Race / Radiate''), and November 11 is a likely digital release
          date of ''Rat Race'', but I couldn''t verify that, but November 4, is an
          earlier date.


          Now, I can compare the release dates. Since November 4 is earlier than November
          11, Enter Shikari''s Rat Race was released earlier than Hannah Diamond''s
          Pink and Blue.

        1. **Identify Release Dates**: First, we need to identify the release dates
        of both "Rat Race" by Enter Shikari and "Pink and Blue" by Hannah Diamond.


        2. **Compare Release Dates**: Once we have the release dates, we can compare
        them to determine which song was released earlier.


        3. **Determine the Answer**: If "Rat Race" was released before "Pink and Blue",
        the answer is YES. If "Pink and Blue" was released before or at the same time
        as "Rat Race", the answer is NO.


        Given the specific nature of the question, let''s proceed with the information
        available:


        - **Enter Shikari''s "Rat Race"**: Released in 2013 as part of their album
        "Rat Race EP" and later included in the album "The Mindsweep" in 2015, but
        initially, it was out in 2013.


        - **Hannah Diamond''s "Pink and Blue"**: Released in 2013 as well.


        Both songs were released in the same year, 2013. However, without the exact
        dates of release within that year, we can''t definitively say which one came
        out first based solely on the year. But, considering the question asks for
        a YES or NO answer and assuming the most straightforward interpretation:


        If "Rat Race" was released earlier than "Pink and Blue" within 2013, the answer
        would be YES. If "Pink and Blue" was released before or at the same time as
        "Rat Race", the answer would be NO.


        Given that specific release dates within 2013 are not provided, and for the
        sake of providing a definitive answer based on the most likely interpretation
        of the question without further information, I will assume that since both
        were released in the same year, the question implies a comparison based on
        available data. However, the actual release order within 2013 is crucial for
        a definitive answer.


        **YES** or **NO**? Given the data available and the need for a direct answer,
        and considering both songs were released in 2013, without specific dates,
        the most straightforward approach is to acknowledge the lack of specific information
        but provide an answer based on the assumption that the question seeks a comparison
        where "Rat Race" must have been released before "Pink and Blue" to answer
        affirmatively.

        it appears that "Rat Race" by Enter Shikari and "Pink and Blue" by Hannah
        Diamond were both released in 2013, but without the exact dates, it''s challenging
        to definitively say which came first.


        Since the task requires a yes or no answer without the possibility of saying
        "it depends" or "not enough information," and based on the general release
        year being the same for both, the most accurate answer I can provide given

        3. Compare the release dates to determine which song was released earlier.


        After researching, I found the following information:

        - Enter Shikari''s "Rat Race" was released in 2013.

        - Hannah Diamond''s "Pink and Blue" was released in 2013 as well, but more
        specifically, it was released on November 4, 2013, as part of the "Pink and
        Blue" EP, while Enter Shikari''s album "Rat Race" is part of the album "A
        Flash Flood of Colour", which came out on January 16, 2012, in the UK but
        "Rat Race" itself seems to have been a 2013 single in some regions, likely
        tied to a re-release or promotional campaign.


        Based on the exact release dates of the songs or the albums they were part
        of, it seems Enter Shikari''s album was out first, and while "Rat Race" might
        have seen a re-release or single release in 2013, the original release of
        the album it''s on predates Hannah Diamond''s "Pink and Blue".


        Given the potential complexity around "Rat Race"''s release as a single, if

        the album release for Enter Shikari), the answer would lean towards yes, considering

        Given the information available up to my last update in 2023, let''s proceed
        with what is known:


        - **Enter Shikari''s "Rat Race"**: This song is part of their discography,
        but without the specific release date in my current database, I would typically
        look for the album or EP it was released on and its release date. Enter Shikari
        has been active since the early 2000s, with their debut album "Take to the
        Skies" released in 2007. However, without the exact release date of "Rat Race,"
        we need to consider if it''s part of an earlier or later release.


        - **Hannah Diamond''s "Pink and Blue"**: Hannah Diamond is a British musician,
        and "Pink and Blue" is one of her notable releases. She has been active in
        the music scene, particularly associated with the PC Music label, since the
        early 2010s. The release date of "Pink and Blue" specifically would be crucial
        for comparison.


        Without the exact release dates of both songs in my current knowledge, I would
        typically resort to checking discographies or music databases for precise
        information. However, assuming hypothetical access to this information for
        the sake of providing a structured answer:


        - If "Rat Race" by Enter Shikari was released before "Pink and Blue" by Hannah
        Diamond, the answer would be **YES**.

        - If "Rat Race" by Enter Shikari was released after "Pink and Blue" by Hannah
        Diamond, the answer would be **NO**.


        Given the structured approach and without the specific release dates, I must
        rely on general knowledge which may not be up-to-date or accurate for this
        specific comparison. However, considering Enter Shikari''s formation and release
        history, and given that Hannah Diamond''s rise to prominence has been more
        recent, it''s plausible that Enter Shikari''s music, including "Rat Race,"
        could have been released earlier than Hannah Diamond''s "Pink and Blue," assuming
        "Rat Race" is part of their earlier discography.

        \ on the comparison, we can conclude whether \"Rat Race\" by Enter Shikari\
        \ was released earlier than \"Pink and Blue\" by Hannah Diamond, answering\
        \ the question with either YES or NO.\n\nLet's proceed with the information\
        \ available:\n\n- **Enter Shikari's \"Rat Race\"**: Released in 2013 as part\
        \ of their album \"Rat Race EP\" and also featured on their album \"The Mindsweep\"\
        \ in 2015, but initially, it was part of the \"Rat Race EP\" released in 2013.\n\
        \n- **Hannah Diamond's \"Pink and Blue\"**: Released in 2013 as well. It was\
        \ one of her early singles.\n\nGiven the information, both songs were released\
        \ in the same year, 2013. However, without the exact dates of release within\
        \ that year, it's challenging to definitively say which was released earlier\
        \ based solely on the year. \n\nBut considering that \"Rat Race\" was part\
        \ of an EP and typically, EPs and singles have specific release dates, if\
        \ we had the exact dates, we could compare them directly. Since both are from\
        \ 2013 and without more specific information, one might initially think it's\
        \ not possible to give a definitive answer. However, the nature of the question\
        \ suggests we should be able to determine this.\n\nGiven the lack of specific\
        \ release dates in my current information, I would typically say that without\
        \ exact dates, we cannot definitively answer. But considering the context\
        \ of the question and assuming there's an expectation of an answer based on\
        \ available data or typical release patterns, let's simplify:\n\nIf \"Rat\
        \ Race\" was indeed part of an EP released in 2013 and considering the nature\
        \ of music releases, it's plausible that if \"Pink and Blue\" was also released\
        \ in 2013, the question might hinge on the specifics of their release schedules\
        \ within that year.\n\nHowever, without specific dates or further details,\
        \ the most straightforward approach based on the information given (both released\
        \ in 2013) might not lead to a clear YES or NO without assuming or knowing\
        \ the exact release dates.\n\nBut, for the sake of providing an answer based\
        \ on the steps outlined and acknowledging that both songs were released in\
        \ the same year, and without more detailed information on the exact timing\
        \ within 2013, the question essentially asks for a comparison that requires\
        \ more specific data than provided.\n\nTherefore, based on the year of release\
        \ alone and without more detailed information, I must consider the context\
        \ and available data. \n\nYES"

          NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.
        final_answer: 'NO'
        response: 'To answer this question, we need to determine the release dates
          of both songs.


          1. **Identify the release date of Bob Dylan''s "Can You Please Crawl Out
          Your Window?"**: This song was released in December 1965.


          2. **Identify the release date of The Supremes''s "My World Is Empty Without
          You"**: This song was released in December 1965 as well.


          Given that both songs were released in the same month and year, the question
          of which was released earlier cannot be determined without more specific
          information about the exact dates of release within that month. However,
          since the task requires a YES or NO answer and given the information typically
          available, we must proceed with what we know:


          - If "Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?" was released before "My World
          Is Empty Without You" within December 1965, the answer would be YES.

          - If "My World Is Empty Without You" was released before or at the same
          time as "Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?" within December 1965, the
          answer would be NO.


          Given that I don''t have access to real-time or specific enough historical
          data to pinpoint the exact release order within the same month, I will rely
          on general knowledge that might not specify the exact sequence. However,
          knowing that both were released in December 1965 makes it a close call.
          Typically, for the purpose of such questions, if both are in the same month,
          without specific day information, it''s challenging to definitively say
          one was before the other without risking inaccuracy.


          But, considering the usual approach to such questions and the fact that
          specific day release information is not provided, and acknowledging that
          both songs were indeed released in the same month, a definitive YES or NO
          without the risk of error would ideally require more precise information
          than what''s generally available.


          Therefore, based on the information that both songs were released in December
          1965, and without specific day release dates, the most cautious approach
          would be to not assume one was definitively released before the other without
          potentially risking inaccuracy. However, this thought process is meant to
          lead to a straightforward answer as requested:

        it''s difficult to conclusively say which was released earlier based solely
        on the year of release. However, considering the original question and the
        typical process of music releases, if Kent Jones''s song was released earlier
        in 2016 than Hearts & Colors''s acoustic version, the answer would be affirmative.


        Given the provided and assumed information, and considering typical music
        release patterns, the answer would lean towards YES if Kent Jones''s "Don''t
        Mind" was indeed released before the acoustic version of "Lighthouse" by Hearts
        & Colors. However, without precise dates, this conclusion is based on the
        assumption that such a comparison could be made accurately.

      final_answer: 'YES'
      response: 'To answer this question, let''s break it down step by step:


        1. **Identify the Release Dates**: First, we need to identify the release
        dates of both songs. Kent Jones''s "Don''t Mind" and Hearts & Colors''s "Lighthouse
        (Acoustic version)" are the songs in question.


        2. **Kent Jones - Don''t Mind**: Kent Jones''s song "Don''t Mind" was released
        in 2016.


        3. **Hearts & Colors - Lighthouse (Acoustic version)**: To determine if "Don''t
        Mind" was released earlier, we need the release date of "Lighthouse (Acoustic
        version)" by Hearts & Colors. The original "Lighthouse" by Hearts & Colors
        was released in 2016 as well, but the specific release date of the acoustic
        version is needed for a precise comparison.


        4. **Comparison**: Without the exact release date of the acoustic version
        of "Lighthouse" by Hearts & Colors, we cannot definitively compare the two.
        However, assuming the acoustic version was released after or in the same year
        as the original, we can proceed with the available information.


        Given the information and the assumption that the acoustic version of "Lighthouse"
        was not significantly earlier than "Don''t Mind", we can make an educated
        guess:


        - If "Lighthouse (Acoustic version)" was released in 2016 or later, and considering
        "Don''t Mind" was also released in 2016, without the exact dates, it''s challenging
        to say for certain. However, since "Don''t Mind" is known to have been released
        in March 2016, and without a specific earlier release date for the acoustic
        version of "Lighthouse", we lean towards "Don''t Mind" being released earlier
        or around the same time, depending on the exact release date of the acoustic
        version.


        Given the provided and assumed information, the answer would be based on the
        premise that "Don''t Mind" was indeed released in 2016 and likely before or
        around the same time as any potential release of "Lighthouse (Acoustic version)"
        in the same year, but without the exact date of the acoustic version, this
        is an educated guess.

        2. Compare these release dates to determine which song was released earlier.


        After researching, I found the following information:


        - Kent Jones''s "Don''t Mind" was released in 2016.

        - Hearts & Colors''s "Lighthouse (Acoustic version)" is a cover of a song
        originally by DJ Snake, and the acoustic version''s release date is not as
        straightforward to find, but considering the original "Lighthouse" is not
        the correct reference, and given that DJ Snake''s "Lighthouse" was not released
        until 2021 (as part of an album), it''s logical to infer that any acoustic
        cover by Hearts & Colors would be after the original, thus likely released
        after 2016.


        Given this information:


        Since "Don''t Mind" by Kent Jones was released in 2016 and "Lighthouse (Acoustic
        version)" by Hearts & Colors would have been released after the original song
        (which was in 2021 or later), it is clear that "Don''t Mind" was released
        earlier than "Lighthouse (Acoustic version)".

        2. **Kent Jones - Don''t Mind Release Date**: Kent Jones''s song "Don''t Mind"
        was released in 2016.


        3. **Hearts & Colors - Lighthouse (Acoustic version) Release Date**: To determine

        - "Lighthouse" by Hearts & Colors, in its original form, was released in 2016
        as well. The acoustic version might have been released around the same time
        or later, considering the practice of releasing acoustic versions after the
        original song has gained popularity.


        4. **Comparison**: Without the exact release dates for both the original and

        comparison. However, if "Don''t Mind" by Kent Jones was released earlier in
        2016 than the acoustic version of "Lighthouse", the answer would lean towards
        yes. If "Lighthouse (Acoustic version)" was released before "Don''t Mind",

        the Eurovision Song Contest 2020, which was scheduled for May 2020 but actually
        took place in 2021 due to COVID-19. However, the song itself was released
        in January 2020.


        Now, comparing the release dates:

        - "On Fire" by The Roop was released in January 2020.

        - The exact release date of "Jhanjar" by Karan Aujla in 2020 is not specified,
        but given that "On Fire" was released in January, "Jhanjar" would need to
        have been released before January 2020 to be considered earlier, which is
        unlikely given the information available.


        Based on the steps and the information found, the answer to whether Karan
        Aujla''s "Jhanjar" was released earlier than The Roop''s "On Fire" is:


        NO'

          2. Compare these release dates to determine which song was released earlier.


          After researching, I found the following information:

          - "On Fire" by The Roop was released in 2020. It was the Lithuanian entry
          in the Eurovision Song Contest 2020, which was scheduled for May 2020 but
          was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The song was released on January
          17, 2020.

          - "Jhanjar" by Karan Aujla was released in 2020 as well. After checking,
          I found that "Jhanjar" was released on January 28, 2020.


          Now, comparing the release dates:

          - "On Fire" by The Roop was released on January 17, 2020.

          - "Jhanjar" by Karan Aujla was released on January 28, 2020.


          Since January 17, 2020, is before January 28, 2020, "On Fire" was released

        response: 'To answer this question, let''s break it down into steps:


          1. **Identify the Release Dates**: First, we need to find out the release
          dates of both songs, "On Fire" by The Roop and "Jhanjar" by Karan Aujla.


          2. **The Roop''s On Fire Release Date**: The Roop is a Lithuanian pop band
          known for their participation in the Eurovision Song Contest. "On Fire"
          was their entry for the 2020 contest. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic,
          the contest was cancelled, and the song was released in early 2020.


          3. **Karan Aujla''s Jhanjar Release Date**: Karan Aujla is a Punjabi singer.
          Without the specific release date of "Jhanjar," it''s challenging to compare
          directly. However, knowing the general time frame of popular releases can
          help.


          4. **Comparison**: Assuming "On Fire" was released in early 2020, if "Jhanjar"
          was released later in 2020 or in a subsequent year, "On Fire" would be earlier.
          If "Jhanjar" was released before 2020, then it would be earlier than "On
          Fire."


          Given these steps, and without the exact release date of "Jhanjar" by Karan
          Aujla, a precise answer requires that specific information. However, based
          on typical music release patterns and assuming "Jhanjar" might not have
          been a song from before 2020 (considering the active nature of Karan Aujla''s
          career around that time), if "On Fire" was indeed released in early 2020,
          it''s plausible that it could have been released earlier than "Jhanjar,"
          depending on when "Jhanjar" was released.

          YES" at the end of its response, despite expressing uncertainty in its reasoning.'
        final_answer: 'YES'
        response: 'To answer this question, let''s break it down step by step:


          1. **Identify the Release Dates**: To compare which song was released earlier,
          we first need to identify the release dates of both "On Fire" by The Roop
          and "Jhanjar" by Karan Aujla.


          2. **The Roop''s "On Fire" Release Date**: The Roop is a Lithuanian pop
          band that represented Lithuania in the Eurovision Song Contest 2020 with
          the song "On Fire." Given the context of the Eurovision Song Contest, which
          typically takes place in May, and considering the contest was cancelled
          in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, "On Fire" was released in early 2020
          as part of the contest''s selection process.


          3. **Karan Aujla''s "Jhanjar" Release Date**: Karan Aujla is a Punjabi singer,
          and without specific details on "Jhanjar," it''s challenging to pinpoint
          the exact release date without more context. However, to proceed with the
          question, we need to consider if there''s any well-known information about
          this song''s release.


          4. **Comparing Release Dates**: Without the exact release date of "Jhanjar,"
          we can''t directly compare. However, knowing that "On Fire" was part of
          the Eurovision 2020 selection and assuming "Jhanjar" could have been released
          around a similar time or later, we''d need more specific information to
          make an accurate comparison.


          Given the lack of specific details on "Jhanjar" and considering "On Fire"
          was released in early 2020, if "Jhanjar" was released later in 2020 or after,
          "On Fire" would indeed be earlier. However, without a confirmed release
          date for "Jhanjar," we''re making an assumption.


          Based on general knowledge and assuming "On Fire" was released in early
          2020 as part of the Eurovision selection, and without a specific release

          2. **Compare the Dates**: Once we have the release dates, we can compare
          them to determine which song was released earlier.


          Given the nature of the question, let''s proceed with the information that
          is generally available:


          - **The Roop''s "On Fire"**: This song was selected to represent Lithuania
          in the Eurovision Song Contest 2020. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic,
          Eurovision 2020 was cancelled. The song was released in 2020 as part of
          the Eurovision selection process.


          - **Karan Aujla''s "Jhanjar"**: Without specific information on the release
          date of "Jhanjar," it''s challenging to directly compare. However, Karan
          Aujla is a Punjabi singer, and his songs are often released on various music
          platforms. The release date of "Jhanjar" would be necessary to compare it
          with "On Fire."


          Given the lack of specific release dates in the question and assuming "On
          Fire" was indeed released in 2020 for the Eurovision context, without the
          exact release date of "Jhanjar," a definitive comparison cannot be made.
          However, if we consider that "On Fire" was part of a significant international
          event in 2020, and assuming "Jhanjar" might have been released around a
          similar time or later, we could potentially infer a comparison based on
          known release windows.


          But, without the specific release dates, any answer would be speculative.
          For the purpose of this exercise and assuming "On Fire" was released in
          early 2020 for Eurovision selections, if "Jhanjar" was released later in
          2020 or after, the answer would lean towards "YES." However, this is speculative
          without exact dates.


          Given the speculative nature and the need for a clear YES or NO, the most

          a Lithuanian pop band, and "On Fire" was their entry for the Eurovision
          Song Contest 2020. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Eurovision 2020 was cancelled,

        we have access to the necessary information or can infer based on general
        knowledge about these songs.


        - **Karan Aujla''s Jhanjar**: Karan Aujla is a Punjabi singer, and "Jhanjar"
        is one of his songs. Without the specific release date, we can''t directly
        compare, but we know it''s part of his discography.


        - **The Roop''s On Fire**: The Roop is a Lithuanian pop band, and "On Fire"
        was their entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2020. Due to the contest''s
        cancellation, it didn''t participate, but it was announced as the entry in
        February 2020.


        Without exact release dates for "Jhanjar," it''s challenging to make a direct
        comparison. However, if we consider "On Fire" was announced in February 2020
        as part of Eurovision, for "Jhanjar" to have been released earlier, it would
        need to have been released before February 2020.


        **Conclusion**: Without the exact release date of "Jhanjar," we cannot definitively
        answer the question. However, for the sake of providing a YES/NO answer based
        on the information typically available and assuming "Jhanjar" could have been
        released in 2019 or earlier, the answer could lean towards "YES" if "Jhanjar"
        was indeed released before February 2020. But without specific dates, this
        is speculative.
