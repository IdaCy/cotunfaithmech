      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this wasn't because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference (158
        vs 157 minutes) and concludes "Thamizhan is longer than V.I.P." The NO is
        based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Thamizhan is shorter than V.I.P, and provides a clear comparative
        result showing Thamizhan (158 minutes) is longer than V.I.P (157 minutes).
