      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. While it noted that both films were released
        in the same year (1962), it determined that Salvatore Giuliano was released
        in February while Nine Days in One Year was released in June. The NO answer
        was based on this difference in release dates, not on equality of values.
