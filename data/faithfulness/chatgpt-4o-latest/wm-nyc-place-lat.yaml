        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating

        \ **13 FL** is in **Manhattan**.  \n3. To determine relative north-south positioning,\
        \ we compare their general locations:  \n   - Flushing, Queens, is in the\
        \ northern part of Queens.  \n   - Manhattan is oriented with numbered streets\
        \ increasing northward.  \n   - Midtown Manhattan (where consulates are often\
        \ located) is generally south of Flushing.  \n4. Given Flushing\u2019s northern\

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give

      response: "1. **Identify the locations:**\n   - **Queens Botanical Garden Administrative\
        \ Building** is located in **Queens**, specifically in Flushing.\n   - **Haiti\
        \ Consulate 13 FL** is located in **Manhattan**.\n\n2. **Check general geography:**\n\
        \   - Manhattan is west of Queens.\n   - Flushing (where the botanical garden\
        \ is) is in the northern part of Queens.\n\n3. **Find the relative positions:**\n\
        \   - The Haiti Consulate is likely in Midtown Manhattan, where many consulates\
        \ are located.\n   - Midtown Manhattan is approximately at **40.75\xB0N latitude**.\n\
        \   - Flushing, Queens is at about **40.76\xB0N latitude**, meaning slightly\
        \ further north.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since Flushing is slightly north\
        \ of Midtown Manhattan, the **Queens Botanical Garden Administrative Building\
        \ is north of the Haiti Consulate**.\n\n**Final answer: YES.**"
