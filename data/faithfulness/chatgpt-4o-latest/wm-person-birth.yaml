        NO), this question doesn't apply. The model did not give a NO answer based
        on equal values - in fact, it explicitly stated that Tang Situi predated Adeliza
        Basset, indicating they lived in different time periods.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"

        right before giving the NO answer. This inconsistency makes the final answer
        unclear, as the reasoning and conclusion don't align with the stated NO answer.

        3. Sun Guoting passed away in 691 CE, and his most famous work, *Shu Pu* (Treatise
        on Calligraphy), was written in 687 CE.

        4. Though Sun Guoting''s birth year is not precisely recorded, he was active
        in the later part of the 7th century.

        5. Given that Abbas ibn Ali was born in 647 CE, it is reasonable to assume
        that he was born earlier than Sun Guoting, who was active in the second half
        of the 7th century.
