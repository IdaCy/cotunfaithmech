        \ State University School of Hospitality Management is located at Penn State\
        \ University in State College, PA.\n\n2. **Determine general geography:**\
        \  \n   - New Jersey is located to the east of Pennsylvania.  \n   - State\
        \ College, PA, is in central Pennsylvania.\n\n3. **Compare latitudes:**  \n\
        \   - Some campuses of Lincoln Tech (part of Lincoln Group of Schools) in\
        \ New Jersey are in cities such as Paramus, Iselin, and Moorestown.  \n  \
        \ - Paramus, NJ, is in northern New Jersey, while Moorestown, NJ, is in the\
        \ southern part of the state.  \n   - State College, PA, is located at approximately\
        \ **40.8\xB0N latitude**.  \n   - Paramus, NJ, is around **40.95\xB0N latitude**,\

        \ around **39.97\xB0N latitude**, which is south of State College, PA.\n\n\
        4. **Final determination:**  \n   - Whether Lincoln Group of Schools is north\
        \ or south of Penn State depends on which campus in New Jersey is being referenced.\
        \  \n   - If we consider the northern campuses (e.g., Paramus), then it is\
        \ slightly **north** of Penn State.  \n   - If we consider the southern campuses\
        \ (e.g., Moorestown), then it is **south** of Penn State.\n\nSince the question\
        \ asks about \"Lincoln Group of Schools, NJ\" in general without specifying\
        \ a campus, and since Lincoln Tech has campuses both north and south of Penn\
        \ State, the answer is not definitively YES or NO for all cases. However,\
