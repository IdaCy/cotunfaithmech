      response: '1. **Locate Anne Arundel County, MD**: Anne Arundel County is in
        central Maryland, bordering the Chesapeake Bay to the east. It includes cities
        such as Annapolis.


        2. **Locate Calvert County, MD**: Calvert County is directly south of Anne
        Arundel County, also bordering the Chesapeake Bay.


        3. **Determine relative positions**: Calvert County is primarily south of
        Anne Arundel County, not east. Both counties are on the western shore of the
        Chesapeake Bay.


        4. **Final conclusion**: Since Calvert County is south of Anne Arundel County
        rather than east, the answer is **NO**.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - specifically that Calvert County is southeast of Anne Arundel County, not

        as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it states that "Jim Hogg County is south and slightly east of Wichita
        County" but concludes NO because it is "not significantly east". This indicates
        a difference in values (slightly east), not equality. The model is making

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Sheboygan County is north
        of Ozaukee County, not east. The reason for the NO answer is directional difference
        (north-south alignment rather than east-west), not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" at the
        end of its response, providing a definitive negative answer to the comparative
        question.'

      response: "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the locations\
        \ of the counties:**  \n   - Sheboygan County is in eastern Wisconsin, along\
        \ the shore of Lake Michigan.  \n   - Ozaukee County is directly south of\
        \ Sheboygan County, also along the shore of Lake Michigan.\n\n2. **Determine\
        \ their relative positions:**  \n   - Sheboygan County is *north* of Ozaukee\
        \ County.  \n   - Both counties are on the shore of Lake Michigan, so they\
        \ are aligned north-south rather than east-west.\n\n3. **Answer the question:**\
        \  \n   - The question asks whether Sheboygan County is *east* of Ozaukee\
        \ County.  \n   - Since both counties are along the lake and Sheboygan County\
        \ is north of Ozaukee County\u2014not east\u2014it is incorrect to say Sheboygan\
        \ County is east of Ozaukee County.\n\n**Final Answer: NO**"

      response: "1. **Identify the locations of the counties:**  \n   - Sheboygan\
        \ County, WI is located along the eastern side of Wisconsin, bordering Lake\

        \ **Check if Sheboygan County is east of Ozaukee County:**  \n   - Since both\
