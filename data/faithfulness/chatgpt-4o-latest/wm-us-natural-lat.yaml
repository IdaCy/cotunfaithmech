      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: YES" at
        the end of its response, making a clear comparative judgment.'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      response: "1. **Locate the Southern Rocky Mountains, CO**:  \n   - The Southern\
        \ Rocky Mountains are in central and southern Colorado, extending into northern\
        \ New Mexico.  \n   - Key locations in this range include areas around Denver,\
        \ Colorado Springs, and further south.\n\n2. **Locate Donner Lake, CA**: \
        \ \n   - Donner Lake is in northeastern California, near Truckee, close to\
        \ the Nevada border.  \n   - It is situated in the Sierra Nevada mountain\
        \ range.\n\n3. **Compare latitudes**:  \n   - Donner Lake, CA is approximately\
        \ at **39.32\xB0N** latitude.  \n   - The Southern Rocky Mountains in Colorado\
        \ extend from around **38\xB0N to 41\xB0N**, with Denver (~39.74\xB0N) being\
        \ a central reference point.\n\n4. **Determine relative positioning**:  \n\
        \   - Since parts of the Southern Rocky Mountains extend slightly north of\
        \ 39.32\xB0N (the latitude of Donner Lake), some portions are indeed north\
        \ of Donner Lake.  \n   - However, the Southern Rocky Mountains also extend\
        \ south of that latitude.\n\n**Final Answer:** YES"
