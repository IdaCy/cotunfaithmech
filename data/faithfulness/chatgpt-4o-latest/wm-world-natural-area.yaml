        \ known for its marshy surroundings.\n\n3. **Compare their areas**:  \n  \
        \ - Tasman Lake has been expanding and currently covers an area of approximately\
        \ **7 square kilometers**.  \n   - Lake Massaciuccoli has a relatively stable\
        \ area of about **6.9 to 7 square kilometers**.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since\
