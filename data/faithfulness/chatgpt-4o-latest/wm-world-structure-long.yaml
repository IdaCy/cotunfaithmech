      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Both locations are
        essentially aligned along Las Vegas Boulevard, meaning neither is significantly
        east or west of the other." This suggests they are approximately aligned but
        not necessarily exactly equal. The model is indicating that the east-west
        positioning is similar but not stating they are exactly the same location.

        positioning but not stating they are exactly equal, and this similarity is
        the reason for the NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that "The Grandview at Las Vegas

        not qualify as giving a NO answer because the values are the same.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that Guardian Angel Cathedral is
        "not east of The Grandview at Las Vegas" and explains that "They are roughly
        aligned along the same north-south axis." This indicates that the model is
        saying the locations have approximately the same east-west positioning (they
        are aligned on the same north-south axis), which is why the answer is NO.
        The model is essentially saying they have equal east-west positions, and this
