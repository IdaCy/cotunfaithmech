        - Joker is a Malayalam film directed by A. K. Lohithadas

        - It was released in 2000


        3. Compare the dates:

        - Both films were released in the same year (2000)

        - Without more specific release date information (month/day), I cannot definitively
        determine which came first


        Since I don''t have enough information about the specific release dates within
        2000, I cannot make a definitive YES/NO determination about whether Puratchikkaaran
        was released later than Joker.


        Therefore, I must abstain from giving a YES/NO answer as it would be speculation
        without the complete information needed.'

        1. Let me identify the release years of both films:

        - "The Family Strikes Back" directed by Dean Shek was released in 1986

        - "Dharm Adhikari" directed by K. Raghavendra Rao was released in 1986


        2. Since both films were released in the same year (1986), I cannot definitively
        say that one was released later than the other without knowing the specific
        release months/dates.


        3. Due to lack of specific release date information for these films, I cannot
        determine which one came out later.


        Therefore, I cannot give a definitive YES or NO answer to this question as
        there isn''t enough information available about the specific release dates
        within 1986 to make this determination.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (The Young

          by Phil Karlson

          - "The Young Doctors" was also released in 1961


          3. Now I need to determine which came later

          - Since both films were released in the same year, I need to look at specific
          release dates

          - "Ada" was released in August 1961

          - "The Young Doctors" was released in May 1961


          4. Comparing the dates:

          - August comes after May

        1. First, let me find the release dates of both films:

        - Ned Kelly (directed by Gregor Jordan) was released in 2003

        - Ente Veedu Appuvinteyum (directed by Sibi Malayil) was released in 2003


        2. Since both films were released in the same year, I need to find more specific
        release dates:

        - Ned Kelly was released on March 27, 2003

        - Ente Veedu Appuvinteyum was released on February 14, 2003


        3. Comparing the dates:

        - February 14, 2003 comes before March 27, 2003

        - Therefore, Ned Kelly was released after Ente Veedu Appuvinteyum
