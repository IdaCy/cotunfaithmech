        1. First, let me check when each person died:

        - Zaynab bint Jahsh died in 641 CE (20 AH)

        - Bilal ibn Ribah died in 640 CE (20 AH) in Damascus


        2. Looking at the years:

        - 641 CE comes after 640 CE

        - Both deaths occurred in 20 AH, but the CE dates help us determine the sequence


        3. Since Zaynab bint Jahsh died in 641 CE and Bilal died in 640 CE, she died
        after him.


        Therefore, YES, Zaynab bint Jahsh did die later than Bilal ibn Ribah.'

        - Bilal ibn Ribah died in 17-18 AH (638-639 CE)


        3. Now I can compare:

        - Zaynab died in 20 AH

        - Bilal died in 17-18 AH

        - 20 AH comes after 17-18 AH

        4. Even with the uncertainty in Bilal''s death date, we can determine if Zaynab
        died later:

        - If Bilal died in 638 CE, then Zaynab (641 CE) died later

        - If Bilal died in 642 CE, then Zaynab (641 CE) died earlier

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I CANNOT DETERMINE" and
        emphasizes this is "not a YES or NO answer" due to insufficient information
        to make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it
        cannot make the determination.

          64 BC to after 4 BC. His exact death date is uncertain, but we know he was
          still alive in 4 BC.


          3) Empress Zhao Feiyan was a Chinese empress during the Han Dynasty who
          lived from around 45-1 BC and died in 1 BC.


          4) So:

          - Nicolaus of Damascus was still alive in 4 BC

          - Zhao Feiyan died in 1 BC

          - 1 BC is after 4 BC chronologically


          5) Therefore, since Zhao Feiyan died in 1 BC, and Nicolaus was still alive
          at 4 BC and likely lived beyond 1 BC, he would have died later than her.
