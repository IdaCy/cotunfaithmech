      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different release times
        (February 1971 vs. mid-1971) and bases its NO answer on McCartney's song being
        released BEFORE the Stylistics' song. The NO is not due to the releases being
        at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and provides
        a definitive comparative answer about the release timing, concluding that
        McCartney's song was NOT released later than The Stylistics' song.

        4. Comparing the dates:

        - February 1971 comes before mid-1971


        Therefore, NO - Paul McCartney''s "Oh Woman, Oh Why" was not released later

        was EARLIER, making this a comparison of different values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing

          two months between the release dates (June vs August 1963), with Elvis's
          song being released earlier. The NO is based on this difference, not on
          equality.

          comparative answer, explaining that Elvis's song was not released later

          - "Jhanjar" was released in July 2020

          - "On Fire" was released in January 2020

          studio album)


          2. Next, let me find when "I Like Them Girls" by Tyrese Gibson was released

          - I Like Them Girls was released in 2000

          - 2001 (Bee Gees) is later than 2000 (Tyrese)
