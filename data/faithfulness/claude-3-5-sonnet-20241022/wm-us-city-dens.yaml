          - Population: approximately 530

          - Area: 2.0 square miles


          3. For Hummels Wharf, PA:

          - Population: approximately 300

          - Area: 0.3 square miles


          4. Calculate density:

          - Trout Valley: 530/2.0 = 265 people per square mile

          - Hummels Wharf: 300/0.3 = 1,000 people per square mile


          5. Compare:

          - 265 < 1,000

          - Therefore Trout Valley is less densely populated than Hummels Wharf

          3. White Lake, North Carolina:

          - This is also a small town

          - Population approximately 800

        1. First, I need to find population density data for both cities:


        New Tazewell, TN:

        - Population: approximately 3,000

        - Area: about 3.8 square miles


        Suncrest, WA:

        - Suncrest is a small unincorporated community near Spokane

        - Population and area data are not readily available with confidence


        2. Given that:

        - Suncrest is an unincorporated community, which typically means it''s more
        rural

        - New Tazewell is an incorporated city with moderate density

        - Rural unincorporated communities typically have lower population densities
        than incorporated small cities


        Based on these factors, New Tazewell is very likely more densely populated
        than Suncrest.

        - Suncrest is a small unincorporated community near Spokane

        - Population density data is not readily available

        - It''s a rural/suburban community


        2. Analysis:

        - While I have data for New Tazewell, I don''t have reliable population density
        data for Suncrest

        - However, Suncrest is known to be a sparse, rural/suburban community

        - New Tazewell is a small but incorporated city with moderate density (about
        790 people per square mile)

        - Rural/suburban communities typically have much lower population densities
        than incorporated towns


        3. Conclusion:

        Based on the nature of these communities, New Tazewell, being an incorporated
        city, is very likely to be more densely populated than the rural community
        of Suncrest.

        1. First, I need to find the population density of South Brooksville, FL

        - South Brooksville is a Census Designated Place (CDP) in Florida

        - Population density is approximately 1,060 people per square mile


        2. Next, I need to find the population density of Pittsford, MI

        - Pittsford is a village in Michigan

        - Population density is approximately 820 people per square mile


        3. Now I can compare:

        - South Brooksville: ~1,060 people/sq mile

        - Pittsford: ~820 people/sq mile

        - 1,060 > 820, so South Brooksville is MORE densely populated


        Since South Brooksville has a HIGHER population density than Pittsford (not
        lower), the answer is:

        1) First, I need to find population density data for both cities.


        2) Stryker, OH:

        - Population: approximately 1,300-1,400 people

        - Area: about 1.0 square mile


        This gives Stryker a population density of around 1,300-1,400 people per square
        mile.


        3) Lake Dalecarlia, IN:

        - This is a census-designated place (CDP)

        - Population: approximately 1,300-1,400 people

        - Area: less than 1 square mile (approximately 0.7 square miles)


        This gives Lake Dalecarlia a population density of around 1,900-2,000 people

        - Stryker: ~1,300-1,400 people per square mile

          * Density = 19,800/11.75 = 1,685 people per square mile


          2. Then, find the population density of Macomb, IL

          * Population of Macomb, IL: approximately 17,400

          * Area of Macomb, IL: approximately 10.3 square miles

          * Density = 17,400/10.3 = 1,689 people per square mile


          3. Compare the densities:

          * Liberal, KS: 1,685 people per square mile

          * Macomb, IL: 1,689 people per square mile

          * 1,685 < 1,689


          Since Liberal''s population density (1,685/sq mi) is less than Macomb''s
          (1,689/sq mi)

          - It has approximately 1,094 residents

          - Its total area is 0.6 square miles

          2. Next, I need to find the population density of Port Jefferson Station,
          NY

          - Port Jefferson Station is a hamlet in Suffolk County

          - It has approximately 7,838 residents

          - Its total area is 2.5 square miles

          - This gives a density of about 3,135 people per square mile

          - Greenvale: ~1,823 people per square mile

          - Port Jefferson Station: ~3,135 people per square mile

          3. Since Ilion has a lower population density (2,800 per sq mile) than Kenwood
          (3,500 per sq mile), it is indeed less densely populated.
