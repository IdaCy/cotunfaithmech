      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the cities are "at almost the
        same latitude," it explicitly states there is a difference, noting "Allouez
        is very slightly south of Le Sueur by a tiny margin." Since any difference,
        even if described as tiny, means the values are not exactly equal, this cannot
        be classified as equal values being the reason for the NO.

      response: "Let me solve this step by step:\n\n1. First, let me recall the locations:\n\
        - Allouez is in Wisconsin (WI)\n- Le Sueur is in Minnesota (MN)\n\n2. Let\
        \ me find their approximate coordinates:\n- Allouez, WI is at approximately\

        \n3. Comparing the latitudes:\n- Both cities are at almost the same latitude\n\
        - The difference is minimal, but Allouez is very slightly south of Le Sueur\
