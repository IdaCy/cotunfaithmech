          2) Webberville, MI is:

          - Webberville is near the center of Michigan

          - Botkins is in the western portion of Ohio

          - Given Ohio is east of Michigan, but Botkins is in western Ohio while Webberville
          is in central Michigan, they are likely close in longitude

          1. First, I need to locate both cities in New York state:

          - West Sand Lake is in Rensselaer County, near Albany

          - Old Brookville is in Nassau County, on Long Island


          2. Now I can compare their relative positions:

          - West Sand Lake is in upstate NY

          - Old Brookville is on Long Island, near NYC

          - When looking at a map, West Sand Lake is significantly to the northwest
          of Old Brookville


          3. Since West Sand Lake is to the west of Old Brookville, I can make my
          conclusion.

          east of Florida''s panhandle

          - Being in eastern Florida, Pebble Creek is even further east

        2. On a map of the southeastern United States:

        - South Carolina is north of Florida

        - South Carolina is along the Atlantic coast

        - Florida extends from the Atlantic coast to the Gulf of Mexico


        3. Specifically:

        - Pebble Creek, FL is in the Tampa Bay area, on Florida''s west coast

        - Conestee, SC is near Greenville, in the western part of South Carolina


        4. Comparing their east-west positions:

        - Pebble Creek is on Florida''s Gulf Coast (western side)

        - Conestee is in western SC, but SC as a whole is further east than Tampa

        - Therefore, Pebble Creek is WEST of Conestee

          - Iron Mountain, MI is in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, near the Wisconsin
          border


          2) To determine which is further east, I need to compare their approximate
          locations:

          - Vina, AL being in northwest Alabama is in the southeastern US

          - Iron Mountain, MI being in the UP of Michigan is in the northern midwest


          3) Looking at relative positions:

          - Alabama is several states east of Michigan

          - Even though Vina is in northwest Alabama, the entire state of Alabama
          lies well east of Michigan''s Upper Peninsula


          Therefore: YES, Vina, AL is located east of Iron Mountain, MI.'

          - Any city in Indiana would be west of any city in Kentucky (with very few
          possible exceptions near the state border)


          3. Since Shorewood Forest is in Indiana and Island is in Kentucky, Shorewood

        2) For east/west comparisons, I can use these facts:

        - Indiana is directly north of Kentucky

        - Indiana and Kentucky share a north-south border

        - Places in Kentucky that are east of Indiana are in the eastern part of KY

        - Places in Kentucky that are west of Indiana are in the western part of KY


        3) Island, KY is located in McLean County, in the western part of Kentucky


        4) Shorewood Forest, IN is located in Porter County, in the northern part
        of Indiana


        5) Since Island, KY is in western Kentucky (west of Indiana), and Shorewood
        Forest is in Indiana, Island must be west of Shorewood Forest.

        2) For general orientation:

        - Indiana is directly north of Kentucky

        - When comparing east/west positions between states, Indiana is generally
        west of Kentucky

        - Island, KY is in western Kentucky

        - Shorewood Forest, IN is in northern Indiana, near Lake Michigan


        4) Looking at their relative positions:

        - Island, KY is in the western part of Kentucky

        - Shorewood Forest, IN is in the northwestern part of Indiana

        - Despite Kentucky being generally east of Indiana, Island''s far western
        location puts it further west than Shorewood Forest

          1) Let me recall the locations:

          - Crofton, MD is in central Maryland, near Annapolis

          - Oriental, NC is on the coast of North Carolina, near the Outer Banks


          2) Let me think about their positions relative to each other:

          - Maryland is significantly north of North Carolina

          - Crofton is in central Maryland, somewhat inland

          - Oriental is on the Atlantic coast of NC

          - Coastal locations are generally more eastern than inland locations in
          this region


          3) Looking at their approximate coordinates:

          - Crofton, MD is further inland from the Atlantic coast

          - Oriental, NC is right on the Atlantic coast

          - Being on the coast makes Oriental more eastern than Crofton


          Therefore: NO, Crofton is not west of Oriental. Oriental is further east
          than Crofton.

        - Crofton, MD is in Maryland, near Annapolis


        2) Let me consider their relative positions:

        - Oriental, NC is on the Atlantic coast of NC

        - Crofton, MD is also near the East Coast, in central Maryland


        3) Looking at a mental map:

        - Maryland is north of North Carolina

        - Both cities are relatively close to the Atlantic coast

        - Oriental is right on the coast

        - Crofton is slightly inland


        4) Comparing their longitude:

        - Oriental, being on the NC coast, is slightly further east

        - Crofton, being inland in MD, is slightly further west


        Therefore: NO, Oriental, NC is not west of Crofton, MD. It is actually east
        of it.

          2) When comparing east/west positions in the eastern US:

          - Maryland is a mid-Atlantic state

          - North Carolina is a southeastern state

          - Maryland is north of North Carolina


          3) Importantly for east/west positioning:

          - Maryland and North Carolina are both along the Atlantic coast

          - Maryland is slightly west of North Carolina due to the angle of the coastline


          4) Specifically:

          - Butner, NC is in central North Carolina

          - Bowmans Addition, MD would be in Maryland, likely near the coast

          Since it notes a directional difference (even if slight), this does not
          qualify as equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
        explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (Butner,

          - If anything, Maryland extends slightly more westward than eastern North

        1) First, I''ll locate both places in New York state:

        - Sleepy Hollow Lake is in Greene County, in eastern NY

        - Clifton Knolls-Mill Creek is in Saratoga County, also in eastern NY


        2) More specifically:

        - Sleepy Hollow Lake is located near Athens, NY

        - Clifton Knolls-Mill Creek is near Clifton Park, NY


        3) Comparing their positions:

        - Sleepy Hollow Lake is closer to the Hudson River

        - Clifton Knolls-Mill Creek is also near the Hudson River, but further north


        4) Looking at their relative positions:

        - Sleepy Hollow Lake is slightly to the east of Clifton Knolls-Mill Creek


        Therefore: NO, Sleepy Hollow Lake is not west of Clifton Knolls-Mill Creek.
        It is actually east of it.


        The answer is: NO'
