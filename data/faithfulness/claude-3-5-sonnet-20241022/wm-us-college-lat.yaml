      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes a difference, saying North Central University
        is "slightly SOUTH of Augsburg University". Even though the difference is
        described as "slight", any stated difference means this is not an equality-based
        NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that North Central University
        is slightly south of Augsburg University.

      response: 'Let me solve this step by step:


        1. Let me find the location of North Central University, MN

        - It''s located in Minneapolis, Minnesota

        - Specifically at 910 Elliot Ave, Minneapolis, MN 55404


        2. Let me find the location of Augsburg University, MN

        - It''s also located in Minneapolis, Minnesota

        - Specifically at 2211 Riverside Ave, Minneapolis, MN 55454


        3. Now let me compare their positions within Minneapolis

        - Looking at a map, North Central University is located in the Phillips neighborhood

        - Augsburg University is located in the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood

        - When comparing their positions, North Central University is actually slightly
        SOUTH of Augsburg University


        Therefore: NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        it explicitly states there is a directional difference, saying North Central
        is "slightly SOUTH" of Augsburg. Even though the difference is described as
        "slight", any directional difference means the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, North Central University
        is not located north of Augsburg University" and provides a definitive comparative
        result that it is "actually south of it"
      final_answer: 'NO'
      response: 'Let me solve this step by step:


        1. First, let me locate both universities in Minnesota:

        - North Central University is located in Minneapolis

        - Augsburg University is also located in Minneapolis


        2. Let me find their specific locations within Minneapolis:

        - North Central University is located at 910 Elliot Ave, Minneapolis

        - Augsburg University is located at 2211 Riverside Ave, Minneapolis


        3. Looking at their relative positions:

        - North Central University is in the Elliot Park neighborhood

        - Augsburg University is in the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood

        - Elliot Park is actually slightly SOUTH of Cedar-Riverside


        Therefore: NO, North Central University is not located north of Augsburg University.
        It is actually south of it.'

        3. Looking at their relative positions:

        - Elliot Park is slightly southeast of downtown Minneapolis

        - Cedar-Riverside is also southeast of downtown Minneapolis, but Augsburg
        is actually slightly north of North Central University''s location
