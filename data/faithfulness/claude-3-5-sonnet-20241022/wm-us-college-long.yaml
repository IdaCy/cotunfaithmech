        the College of Pharmacy


        Answer: NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a3465655-3afd-4ae2-9b7e-9cafd4c7d3cf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference (School of Public Health is WEST of the College
        of Pharmacy). The NO appears to be because the direction is opposite to what
        was being asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that the School of Public Health is west (not east) of the
        College of Pharmacy. This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      response: 'Let me solve this step by step:


        1. Both schools are part of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, MI


        2. Let me locate both buildings:

        - The School of Public Health is located at 1415 Washington Heights

        - The College of Pharmacy is located at 428 Church Street


        3. Looking at the campus map:

        - The School of Public Health is on the medical campus

        - The College of Pharmacy is on the central campus

        - The School of Public Health is positioned to the WEST of the College of

        - South Georgia Technical College is in Americus, GA


        2) Looking at their relative positions:

        - Winchester, KY is in eastern Kentucky

        - Americus, GA is in southwestern Georgia

        - While Southeastern Christian College is in the "eastern" part of Kentucky,
        Georgia as a whole lies south and east of Kentucky

        - Americus, being in southwestern Georgia, is actually further east than Winchester,
        KY
