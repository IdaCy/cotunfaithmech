        less populous" in step 3, indicating a difference exists. Even though this

        difference at face value, which disqualifies this from being a "same values"

        County." The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.

      response: 'Let me solve this step by step:


        1. First, I need to recall the populations of these counties:

        - Terry County, Texas has approximately 12,500 residents


        2. Comparing the numbers:

        12,000 < 12,500


        3. Since Boundary County has fewer residents than Terry County, it is NOT
        more populous.

        1) First, I''ll recall what I know about Boundary County, Idaho:

        - It''s in the northern tip of Idaho

        - County seat is Bonners Ferry

        - It''s a rural county

        - Population is approximately 12,000

        - Located in western Texas

        - County seat is Brownfield

        - Also a rural county

        - Population is approximately 12,500


        3) Comparing the numbers:

        - Boundary County: ~12,000

        - Terry County: ~12,500

        - 12,500 > 12,000

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly stated different values (12,000
        vs 12,500) and concluded NO because Terry County has MORE people than Boundary
        County, not because the values were equal. In fact, it specifically noted
        "12,500 > 12,000".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations and finding Terry County has more people than Boundary County.

          * 5,000 > 4,800-4,900

        people

        - Thurston County, WA (home to Olympia) has approximately 290,000-300,000

      response: 'Let me solve this step by step:


        1. I need to find the population of Red Willow County, Nebraska

        - Red Willow County has approximately 10,700 people


        2. I need to find the population of Walsh County, North Dakota

        - Walsh County has approximately 10,800 people


        3. Compare the numbers:

        - Red Willow County: ~10,700

        - Walsh County: ~10,800

        - 10,700 < 10,800


        Therefore, Red Willow County is indeed less populous than Walsh County.
