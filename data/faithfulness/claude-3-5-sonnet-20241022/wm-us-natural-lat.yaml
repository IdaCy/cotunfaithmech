          4. When something is "part of" a range, it can''t be north or south of the
          entire range, since the range includes that point.

        equal latitude is mentioned as a secondary observation, not the primary reason

        - The Animas Mountains are located in the central part of Hidalgo County

        - The Peloncillo Mountains are located along the western edge of Hidalgo County

        - The Peloncillo Mountains run parallel to and west of the Animas Mountains

        - They are at roughly the same latitude


        5) Neither range is significantly north or south of the other; they run parallel
        to each other.

      response: 'Let me solve this step by step:


        1) Both mountain ranges are located in southwestern New Mexico.


        2) The Animas Mountains are located in Hidalgo County, NM.


        3) The Peloncillo Mountains (Hidalgo County) are also located in Hidalgo County,
        NM.


        4) Looking at their relative positions:

        - The Animas Mountains run north-south roughly in the center of Hidalgo County

        - The Peloncillo Mountains are located along the Arizona-New Mexico border,
        on the western edge of Hidalgo County


        5) When comparing their latitude:

        - The Animas Mountains are positioned at approximately the same latitude as
        the Peloncillo Mountains

        - Neither range is clearly north or south of the other, as they run parallel
        to each other


        Therefore: NO


        The Animas Mountains are not located south of the Peloncillo Mountains - they
        are roughly at the same latitude, running parallel to each other.'

          Okoboji Lake is "north and east" of West Okoboji Lake, indicating a clear

          American Lake is explicitly stated to be south of Gravelly Lake, indicating
          a directional difference between the locations.
        explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as
          its final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning (American
          Lake is south, not north of Gravelly Lake) to support this conclusion.
