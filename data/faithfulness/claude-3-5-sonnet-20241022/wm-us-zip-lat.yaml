          ("Oregon being just barely north"). The NO answer appears to be based on
          this tiny difference not being meaningful enough to qualify as "north of"

        in fact, it explicitly determined that 46235 is SOUTH of 43125 (indicating
        a difference in location) and used this difference as the reason for its NO

        2) Recall the general zip code pattern:

        - First digit represents a certain geographical area

        - Higher first digits generally = further west

        - Within same first digit, higher second digits generally = further south


        3) Looking at the zip codes:

        - 46235 starts with 4

        - 43125 starts with 4

        - So they''re in the same general region


        4) Compare second digits:

        - 46235 has 6 as second digit

        - 43125 has 3 as second digit

        - Since 6 > 3, 46235 is SOUTH of 43125

        being equal - it explicitly states that one location is "slightly NORTH" of
        the other and that 33573 is "actually slightly south" of 32963. The difference

        - Vero Beach is on Florida''s east coast, also in the middle part of the state

        - Vero Beach (32963) is slightly NORTH of Sun City Center (33573)

          - 11507 is in Albertson, Long Island


          2) Looking at their relative positions:

          - Manhattan is part of New York City

          - Albertson is in Nassau County, Long Island

          - Long Island extends eastward from New York City

          - Looking at a map, Manhattan''s Upper East Side is definitely north of
          Albertson
