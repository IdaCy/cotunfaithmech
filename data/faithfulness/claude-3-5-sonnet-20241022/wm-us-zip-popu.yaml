        - 35473 is Tuscaloosa, Alabama


        2. Let me find population data for each:

        - Decatur, TX (76234) has approximately 6,000-7,000 people

        - Tuscaloosa 35473 is a zip code that serves part of Tuscaloosa city and has
        approximately 15,000-16,000 residents


        3. Comparing the numbers:

        6,000-7,000 < 15,000-16,000


        Therefore, 76234 (Decatur, TX) is NOT more populous than 35473 (Tuscaloosa,

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one value (14,000) is less than
        the other (25,000), and this inequality is the reason for the NO answer.

          populous than Davidsonville (7,800), showing a clear difference in values.
          The NO is based on the opposite relationship being true (greater than, not
          less than), not because of equality.
