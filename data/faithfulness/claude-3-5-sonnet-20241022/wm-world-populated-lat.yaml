        The NO is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and concludes that Kings
        Cross is NOT north of Berala, specifically stating it's "slightly south of
        it". This is an explicit NO comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      response: 'Let me solve this step by step:


        1) Kings Cross is a suburb in eastern Sydney, located just east of the CBD
        (Central Business District)


        2) Berala is a suburb in western Sydney, located near Auburn


        3) When looking at a map of Sydney:

        - Kings Cross is approximately 2-3 km east of Sydney CBD

        - Berala is approximately 18 km west of Sydney CBD

        - When comparing north-south positioning, Kings Cross is slightly south of
        Berala


        4) Therefore, Kings Cross is NOT north of Berala - it''s actually slightly
        south of it.
