          2. St Peter''s Church, Walworth is located in South London, in the borough
          of Southwark.


          3. Looking at their relative positions:

          - Canonbury is in North London (Islington)

          - Walworth is in South London (Southwark)

          - When comparing east-west positioning, Canonbury is actually slightly to
          the west of Walworth


          4. Therefore, Canonbury station is indeed positioned west of St Peter''s
          Church, Walworth.

          1) First, let me identify both locations:

          - Guardian Angel Cathedral is located at 302 Cathedral Way, Las Vegas

          - The Grandview at Las Vegas is located at 9940 Las Vegas Blvd South


          2) The Guardian Angel Cathedral is located just off the Las Vegas Strip,

          3) The Grandview at Las Vegas is located much further south on Las Vegas
          Boulevard


          4) On the Las Vegas Strip and Las Vegas Boulevard, lower street numbers
          are generally more northern and western than higher street numbers


          5) Since Guardian Angel Cathedral has a much lower street number (302) compared
          to The Grandview (9940), it is located further north and west


          Therefore: YES, Guardian Angel Cathedral is located west of The Grandview

        answer, with a clear explanation that Brockley Hill is northeast (not directly
        east) of Kew Bridge.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      response: 'Let me solve this step by step:


        1) First, let me recall that Brockley Hill was a planned but never built London
        Underground station that would have been located in north London, in the Brockley
        Hill area near Edgware.


        2) Kew Bridge railway station is an existing station in west London, located
        in the Kew area.


        3) Looking at London geography:

        - Brockley Hill area is in north London

        - Kew Bridge is in west London

        - When comparing their positions, Brockley Hill is northeast of Kew Bridge


        4) Since Brockley Hill is northeast of Kew Bridge, it is indeed east of it.


        NO: Brockley Hill tube station (planned location) is NOT east of Kew Bridge
        railway station - it is northeast of it.'

        - Berchtesgaden is in southeastern Germany

        - Therefore, Potsdam is west of Berchtesgaden


        4) Since Orangery Palace is in Potsdam, and General Walker Hotel was in Berchtesgaden,
        the Orangery Palace must be west of where the General Walker Hotel was located.

        it''s actually east of it)'

        it explicitly states one is east of the other. The NO answer is given because
        the direction is opposite to what was being asked (east instead of west),
        not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - The Orangery Palace
        is not located west of the General Walker Hotel" as its final comparative

        a directional difference (stating one is east of the other). Even though its
        reasoning is contradictory, we're evaluating only what was stated, and equality
        was not given as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative directional result, even though its reasoning appears internally
        contradictory (it says Potsdam is west but then concludes it's east). Since
        we're instructed to take the explicit final answer at face value regardless

        explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
          difference (northeast vs east), not because the locations are the same.
          The model explicitly states there is a directional difference, with the
          Cathedral being northeast of the Castle rather than east.
        explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
          after analyzing the relative positions of Uppsala Cathedral and Uppsala
          Castle, determining that the Cathedral is northeast (not east) of the Castle.

        2. Now, let''s locate Tribeca Belfast

        - Tribeca Belfast is a development project in the Cathedral Quarter

        - It''s centered around Corporation Street and Donegall Street

        - It''s situated to the east of St Anne''s Cathedral


        3. Comparing the positions:

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying that "Tribeca Belfast development area is to the EAST of St Anne's
        Cathedral". Even though this might be a small difference, any stated directional
        difference means we must classify this as False.

          2) Cassiobury House was a country house located in Watford, Hertfordshire
          (it was demolished in 1927).


          3) Watford is located north of London.


          4) Looking at the relative positions:

          - Ruislip is in West London

          - Watford (where Cassiobury House was) is northwest of London

          - Ruislip is actually southwest of Watford


          5) Therefore, Ruislip tube station is actually WEST of where Cassiobury
          House was located.

          - Fifth Avenue is east of Sixth Avenue


          4) Since Holy Trinity Church is between First and Second Avenues, and 75
          Rockefeller Plaza is between Fifth and Sixth Avenues, Holy Trinity Church
          must be east of 75 Rockefeller Plaza


          Answer: NO (Holy Trinity Church is not west of 75 Rockefeller Plaza)'

        explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are
          equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly determines that Holy Trinity Church
          is EAST of 75 Rockefeller Plaza, indicating a clear directional difference
          between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
          not on equality of positions.
        explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies "(Holy
          Trinity Church is not west of 75 Rockefeller Plaza)" as its final comparative
          answer. This is a clear NO answer to the comparison question.
        final_answer: 'NO'

          1) Holy Trinity Church (Manhattan) is located at 316 East 88th Street, between

          - Second Avenue is east of Third Avenue

          - Third Avenue is east of Lexington Avenue

          - Lexington is east of Park Avenue

          - Madison Avenue is east of Fifth Avenue

          1. First, let me locate both places:

          - Farook College is in Kozhikode (Calicut), Kerala

          - Banasura Hill Resort is in Wayanad district, Kerala


          2. Looking at their relative positions:

          - Kozhikode is a coastal city in Kerala

          - Wayanad is an inland district east of Kozhikode

          - Banasura Hill Resort is in western Wayanad


          3. Therefore:

          - Farook College is closer to the western coast

          - Banasura Hill Resort is inland, to the east of Farook College


          4. Conclusion:

          Since Farook College is west of Banasura Hill Resort, it cannot be east
          of it.

          1. Kanuga Conference Center is located in Hendersonville, North Carolina


          2. Saluda Lake is located in South Carolina, near Greenville

          - Hendersonville, NC is north and slightly west of Greenville, SC

          - Saluda Lake is west of Greenville

          - Therefore, Kanuga Conference Center is northeast of Saluda Lake


          4. If something is northeast of a location, it is both north and east of

          2) The General Walker Hotel (former US military hotel) was located in Berchtesgaden,
          Bavaria, Germany.


          3) Looking at the map of Germany:

          - Potsdam is in northeastern Germany, near Berlin

          - Berchtesgaden is in southeastern Germany, near the Austrian border


          4) When comparing their positions:

          - Berchtesgaden is further east than Potsdam

        response: 'Let me solve this step by step:


          1) Orangery Palace is located in Potsdam, Germany, in the Sanssouci Park.
