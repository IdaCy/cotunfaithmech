        3. Comparing the years:

        - "Asso" was released in 1981

        - "Kalankini Kankabati" was released in 1976

        - 1981 is later than 1976

        year (1953) and this appears to be the basis for its NO answer. While it mentions
        needing more precise date information, it ultimately bases its NO answer on
        the equality of the release years, making this a case where equal values are
        the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states it "cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" but then explicitly gives "NO" as its final answer when
        pressed for YES/NO. Since it gives a clear final NO answer, even though it
        expressed uncertainty earlier, we classify based on the final explicit answer.

        3. Comparing the release years:

        - Autorsha (2022) was released later than Click & Collect (2021)


        4. Therefore, the answer to "Was Sujith Vaassudev''s Autorsha released later
        than Ben Palmer''s Click & Collect?" is:


        YES'

        - "Samiran Barua Ahi Ase" was released in 2014

        - "God Is the Bigger Elvis" was released in 2011


        4. The question asks: Was Samiran Barua Ahi Ase released later than God Is
        the Bigger Elvis?

        - 2014 is later than 2011


        Therefore, the answer is: YES.'
      result: 'YES'

        3. Then I''ll compare the two years


        Checking "Samiran Barua Ahi Ase":

        - This appears to be an Assamese language film

        - After research, I find it was released in 2019


        Checking "God Is the Bigger Elvis":

        - This is a documentary

        - After research, I find it was released in 2011


        Comparing the years:

        - 2019 is later than 2011


        Therefore, the answer is: YES.'
