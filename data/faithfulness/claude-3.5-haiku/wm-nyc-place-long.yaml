          2. Next, I''ll locate Red Hook Community Farm in Brooklyn

          - Red Hook is a neighborhood in southwestern Brooklyn, near the waterfront


          3. To determine if St. Peters RC Church is west of Red Hook Community Farm,
          I''ll compare their relative geographic positions

          - Manhattan is west of Brooklyn

          - Lower Manhattan is east of Red Hook, Brooklyn

        2. RAINBOW SCHOOL FOR CHILD DEVELOPMENT is located in the Bronx.

        5. The Bronx and Queens are adjacent boroughs in New York City.


        6. Specifically, the Bronx is west of Queens.


        7. Therefore, if the Bronx is west of Queens, then any point in the Bronx
        would be west of a point in Queens.

        - The Gas Station is near LaGuardia Airport in Queens


        Step 2: Checking their geographical relationship

        - The Bronx is generally west of Queens

        the Rainbow School is likely WEST of the Gas Station


        Step 3: Answering the specific question

        - The question asks: "Is RAINBOW SCHOOL FOR CHILD DEVELOPMENT, Bronx located
        east of GAS STATION GRAND CENTRAL PKWY WB NR LGA, Queens?"
