      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a difference in
        timing, not equality. It explicitly states that "Duke Cheng of Qi lived and
        died earlier than King Hiram I" and provides different dates for their reigns
        (969-936 BCE vs 1042-1024 BCE). The NO is based on this temporal difference,
        not because the dates were the same.

      final_answer: 'YES'
      response: 'Let me break this down step by step:


        1. Zaynab bint Jahsh was one of the wives of Prophet Muhammad and a prominent
        figure in early Islamic history.


        2. Bilal ibn Ribah was a prominent companion of Prophet Muhammad, known as
        the first muezzin (caller to prayer) in Islam.


        3. Both were contemporaries during the time of Prophet Muhammad in the 7th
        century.


        4. Zaynab bint Jahsh died around 640 CE, during the caliphate of Umar ibn
        al-Khattab.


        5. Bilal ibn Ribah died around 640 CE as well, but some sources suggest he
        might have died slightly earlier.


        6. While the exact dates are not perfectly precise, most historical sources
        indicate that Zaynab bint Jahsh died around the same time or potentially slightly
        later than Bilal ibn Ribah.


        Therefore, the answer is: YES, Zaynab bint Jahsh died later than (or around
        the same time as) Bilal ibn Ribah.'

        1. Zaynab bint Jahsh was one of Prophet Muhammad''s wives, and she was an

        2. Bilal ibn Ribah was a prominent companion of the Prophet Muhammad, known

        died very close to each other, but with a slight possibility that Bilal died
        first.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 8 and again as a final standalone answer. The model provides

        3. William Warham was the Archbishop of Canterbury from 1503 to 1532.

        7. Since Warham died in 1532 and Grevenstein died in 1538, Grevenstein died

          - Alemanno Adimari died around the end of the 14th century, likely after

          the death dates were equal. Instead, the model concluded NO based on its
          reasoning that Asclepiades was still alive when Berenice I died (281 BCE),
          indicating different death dates. The NO was based on a temporal difference,
