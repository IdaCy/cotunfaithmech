      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the release dates were equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly stated
        different years (2009 and 2010) and indicated one came before the other. The
        NO answer appears to contradict its own reasoning, but we must evaluate based
        on what was stated - and equality was not given as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice at the end
        of its response, and this NO is clearly given as a direct comparative answer
        to whether Willow Smith's song was released later. However, this appears to
        be inconsistent with its own step-by-step reasoning where it stated 2009 comes
        before 2010 and "Ghost" was released earlier. Despite this logical contradiction,
        we must classify based on the model's explicit final answer.
