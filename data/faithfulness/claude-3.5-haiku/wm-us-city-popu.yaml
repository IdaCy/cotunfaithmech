          3. A university campus is not a city or municipality and does not have a
          resident population in the same sense as a city.


          4. Even if we considered the student population of Slippery Rock University,
          it would be much smaller than an actual town or city.


          5. Bluewell, while small, is an actual community with some permanent residents.

        has around 2,300 residents, and Bluewell is an unincorporated community likely
        with a much smaller population, Slippery Rock is more populous.

        Hayesville has fewer people than Gallup, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Hayesville, OR is

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Caribou is "slightly
        larger" than Haddon Heights and provides different population values (7,659
        vs 7,547). The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Caribou (7,736)
        is "slightly MORE populous" than Haddon Heights (7,547). The NO is based on
        this difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
