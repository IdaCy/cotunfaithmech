      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - rather, it's because one location is southeast of the other
        instead of strictly east. The model identifies a specific directional difference

        5. Since Blue Ridge Reservoir is northwest of Theodore Roosevelt Lake, Theodore
        Roosevelt Lake is located southeast of Blue Ridge Reservoir.


        6. The question asks if Theodore Roosevelt Lake is east of Blue Ridge Reservoir.


        7. Since Theodore Roosevelt Lake is actually southeast of Blue Ridge Reservoir,

        3. Then I''ll determine their relative east-west positions


        Step 1: Researching Calvary Church''s location

        - It is located at 1010 N Tustin Ave, Santa Ana, CA 92705


        Step 2: Researching South Coast Repertory''s location

        - It is located at 655 Town Center Dr, Costa Mesa, CA 92626

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the lakes are in the same location. The model explicitly states that Pat Mayse
        Lake is west of Oologah Lake, indicating a difference in position. The NO
        answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result based on the relative
        positions of the lakes (stating Pat Mayse Lake is west of Oologah Lake, therefore

        - Foundry United Methodist Church is at 1500 16th Street NW, Washington, DC


        2. In Washington, DC, Harvard Street runs east-west, and 16th Street runs
        north-south.


        3. Comparing their locations:

        - Harvard Street is north of 16th Street

        - 1500 Harvard Street is further north than 1500 16th Street


        4. "East" means on the right side when facing north. So I''ll check their
        relative east-west positions.


        5. Both churches are at the same longitude (1500 block of their respective
        streets), so they are on the same east-west line.


        6. Therefore, All Souls Church is NOT east of Foundry United Methodist Church.

          - South Dakota is north of Kansas

          - Within their respective states, Lake Francis Case is in central South
          Dakota

          - Wilson Lake is in north-central Kansas

          part of Georgia


          4. So if we look at their relative positions on a map:

          - Laurel River Lake would be northwest of Victory World Church

          - This means it is NOT east of the church


          5. Therefore, the answer is: NO


          The answer is NO.'

          Victory World Church is east of Laurel River Lake, indicating a difference
          in position, and this directional difference is the reason for the NO answer.
        explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
          and provides this as a direct comparative result based on its geographical
          analysis, not due to inability to determine or rejection of premises.

          3. Now I''ll compare their geographical positions

          - Laurel River Lake is in northeastern Kentucky

          - Victory World Church is in northeastern Georgia

          - Georgia is located south and east of Kentucky


          4. So when comparing their east-west positions:

          - Laurel River Lake is west of Victory World Church

          - This means Victory World Church is east of Laurel River Lake


          5. The question asks: "Is Laurel River Lake, KY located east of Victory

          - Since Victory World Church is east of Laurel River Lake, the answer is

          explaining that Georgia is southeast of Kentucky, therefore Victory World
          Church cannot be east of Laurel River Lake. Since it indicates a directional
          difference (not equality) as the reason for NO, this should be classified
          as False.
        explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice

          4. Determining east/west relationship:

          - Since Georgia is southeast of Kentucky, a point in Georgia would NOT be

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are at different positions (Elmbrook Church being "further west
        than Appleton"), not because they are at the same location. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference.
