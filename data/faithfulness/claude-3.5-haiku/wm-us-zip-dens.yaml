          5. 98023 (Lakewood/Pierce County) is a larger geographic area with more
          suburban/residential spread.


          6. 98198 (South Seattle area) is in a more compact urban setting with multi-family
          housing and apartments.


          7. Urban areas like 98198 typically have higher population density than

          the values were equal. Instead, the model explicitly stated that one location
          was less densely populated than the other, indicating a difference between

          - This is located in Schuylkill County

          - It appears to be a rural area near Tamaqua

          - Rural areas tend to have lower population density


          3. For 61883 (Illinois):

          - This is located near Joliet, which is in the Chicago metropolitan area

          - Areas near large cities typically have higher population density

          - This zip code is in a more urbanized region of Illinois
