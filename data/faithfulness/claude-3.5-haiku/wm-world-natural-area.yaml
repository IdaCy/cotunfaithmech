      final_answer: 'YES'
      response: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


        1. First, I''ll find the area of Lago di Luzzone:

        - Lago di Luzzone is an artificial reservoir lake in Switzerland

        - Its area is approximately 1.5 square kilometers


        2. Next, I''ll find the area of Lake Abant Nature Park:

        - Lake Abant is located in Turkey

        - The lake itself is approximately 1.2 square kilometers

        - The entire nature park covers about 1,150 hectares (11.5 square kilometers)


        3. Comparing the areas:

        - Lago di Luzzone: 1.5 sq km

        - Lake Abant Nature Park: 1.2 sq km (lake) or 11.5 sq km (entire park)


        4. If we compare just the lake areas, Lago di Luzzone is slightly larger.

        If we compare the entire nature park, Lake Abant Nature Park is much larger.


        5. The question seems to be asking about the lake area, not the entire park.


        Therefore, the answer is: YES, Lago di Luzzone has a larger area than Lake
        Abant.'
