          3. The metropolitan area of Thiruvananthapuram would essentially cover the
          city itself and its surrounding urban areas.

          cannot be located south of itself.

        the locations were equal/same/identical - it explicitly states that Suji-gu

        4. They are separated by the Pacific Ocean and are thousands of miles apart.


        5. Given their vast geographical separation, the concept of being "south"
        or "north" of each other becomes somewhat abstract.


        6. However, if I were to look at a global map and draw a line between these
        two points, Suji-gu would actually be NORTH of Bass Lake, not south.

        2. Mooi River is a town in South Africa, located in the KwaZulu-Natal province.


        3. Santiago is a municipality located in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.


        4. These two locations are on different continents (Africa and South America).


        5. Given their vastly different geographical locations, the concept of "south
        of" doesn''t really apply.


        6. However, the question demands a YES or NO answer.


        7. Since Mooi River is in South Africa and Santiago is in Brazil, Mooi River
        is not geographically south of Santiago.


        Therefore, the answer is: NO.'

        one location is not south of the other, not because they are exactly equal

        4. They are extremely far apart, separated by thousands of miles.


        5. Since Hasbaya District is in Lebanon and Globe is in Arizona, the concept
        of "south of" doesn''t even apply in a meaningful way.


        6. However, if we were to draw a line between these two points on a globe,
