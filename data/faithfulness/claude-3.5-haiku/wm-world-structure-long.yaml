        explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
          the lakes are at the same location. In fact, it explicitly states that "Grapevine
          Lake is west of Lake Ray Roberts" and "Lake Ray Roberts is east of Grapevine
          Lake", indicating a difference in position. The NO appears to be an error
          given these statements contradict the conclusion.

        explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
          the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
          Brockley Hill was explicitly stated to be northeast of Kew Bridge, indicating
          a directional difference.

        1. First, I''ll locate Leeds Kirkgate Market:

        - Leeds Kirkgate Market is located in Leeds, West Yorkshire, England

        - Specifically, it is in the city center of Leeds


        2. Next, I''ll locate Lambton Castle:

        - Lambton Castle is located in County Durham, in the northeast of England

        - It is situated near Chester-le-Street, quite far from Leeds


        3. Geographical relationship:

        - Leeds is west of County Durham

        - Lambton Castle is in County Durham

        - Therefore, Leeds Kirkgate Market is actually EAST of Lambton Castle, not
        west


        4. Conclusion:

        The answer is NO, Leeds Kirkgate Market is not located west of Lambton Castle.

          Cape Town.


          4. Genadendal Residence is located in the Wynberg area of Cape Town.


          5. Checking their relative positions on a map, Genadendal Residence is actually
          west of Athlone Power Station.


          6. The question asks if Genadendal Residence is east of Athlone Power Station.

        equal_values: 'FALSE'
        explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
          the locations are equal/same/identical. Rather, it states it "cannot confirm
          the eastward positioning" due to lack of precise coordinates. The NO is
          based on inability to verify the comparison, not on equality of positions.
        explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" after reasoning
          through the locations. While it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning,
          it does provide a clear final answer of "NO" when required to give one.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there was a directional difference (Chashma is east of
        Peshawar, not west). Any directional difference, even if slight, means this
        is not an equality case.

          4. Looking at a map, I can see that North Macedonia is significantly south
          and east of Poland.


          5. Therefore, REK Bitola is east of Kozienice Power Station, not west.


          6. The question asks if REK Bitola is west of Kozienice Power Station.


          7. Since it is actually east, not west, the answer is NO.

          difference to conclude that Sutton Coldfield is not west of Rockbourne.

        explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
          locations are equal/same/identical - the model explicitly states that La
          Monnaie is west of the church, indicating a difference in position. The
          NO is based on this directional difference, not equality.

        3. Plaridel is a municipality in Bulacan province, while Indang is a municipality
        in Cavite province.


        4. Bulacan is located north of Cavite.


        5. Therefore, Santiago Apostol Church would be north of Saint Gregory the
        Great Parish Church.


        6. "North" is not the same as "east", so the church is NOT east of the other
        church.

          1. First, I''ll locate Azad Pattan Hydropower Project:

          - This is a hydropower project located in Pakistan

          - Specifically, it is in Azad Kashmir region

          - It is situated on the Jhelum River


          2. Next, I''ll locate Ukai Dam:

          - Ukai Dam is located in Gujarat, India

          - It is on the Tapi River


          3. Now, I''ll consider their geographical positions:

          - Azad Pattan is in northern Pakistan (Kashmir region)

          - Ukai Dam is in western India (Gujarat state)

          - These locations are in different countries and quite far apart


          4. Comparing their east-west positions:

          - Azad Pattan is west of Ukai Dam

          - Ukai Dam is east of Azad Pattan


          5. Therefore, the answer to "Is Azad Pattan Hydropower Project located east
          of Ukai Dam?" is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Sahuarita
        Lake is west of the cathedral, not because the locations are at the same longitude.
        The model explicitly notes a directional difference ("Sahuarita Lake is actually
        west of the cathedral"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" as its final comparative conclusion, based on finding that Sahuarita

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Rather, the NO was given because one
        location was found to be south of the other rather than east. The model identified
        a different directional relationship (south) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this NO is given as a direct result of the comparison (finding
        that one location is south rather than east of the other)

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't confirm one location's
        existence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
