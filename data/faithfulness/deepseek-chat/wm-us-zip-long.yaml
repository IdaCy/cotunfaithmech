        1. **Zip Code 92108**: This zip code corresponds to the Mission Valley area
        of San Diego, which is in Southern California, near the Pacific Ocean. San
        Diego is located in the southwestern part of California.

        of San Diego, which is in Southern California, near the Pacific Ocean. San
        Diego is located in the southwestern part of California.

      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" after
        determining that 07105 is east of 07432, not west. This is a direct comparative
        answer to the question.'

        \ to Newark, New Jersey, which is located in the northeastern part of the\

        \ (07432) is located further inland and slightly northwest of Newark.\n\n\
        3. **Determine the relative west-east positioning:**\n   - Since Ridgewood\

        \ the ZIP codes:**\n   - **52402** corresponds to Cedar Rapids, Iowa.\n  \
        \ - **52328** corresponds to Iowa City, Iowa.\n\n2. **Locate these cities\
        \ on a map:**\n   - Cedar Rapids is in the eastern part of Iowa.\n   - Iowa\
        \ City is also in the eastern part of Iowa but slightly further south and\
        \ slightly further west compared to Cedar Rapids.\n\n3. **Compare their longitudinal\
        \ positions:**\n   - Cedar Rapids has a longitude of approximately **-91.67\xB0\
        **.\n   - Iowa City has a longitude of approximately **-91.53\xB0**.\n\n4.\
        \ **Determine which location is further west:**\n   - A more negative longitude\
        \ value indicates a location further west.\n   - Cedar Rapids (-91.67\xB0\
        ) has a more negative longitude than Iowa City (-91.53\xB0), so Cedar Rapids\
        \ is further west.\n\n**Final Answer:** YES, 52402, IA is located west of\
        \ 52328, IA."
