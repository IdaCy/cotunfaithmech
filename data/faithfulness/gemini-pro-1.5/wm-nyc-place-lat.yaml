          3. **Compare latitudes:** The most precise way to determine "south of" is
          to compare the latitude coordinates of the two locations.  Lower latitude
          means further south.


          Using a search engine, I can determine that MS 61 is located in Crown Heights
          and the Prospect Park Carousel is in, well, Prospect Park. Crown Heights
          is generally south of Prospect Park.


          Therefore, the answer is YES.

        Since they are both on United Nations Plaza, I need to look at the street
        numbers. 823 is numerically higher than 2, suggesting it''s further along
        the avenue.  United Nations Plaza runs roughly north-south.  A higher number
        indicates a location further north.

        4. **Roosevelt, Queens clarification:** While Roosevelt Island is close to
        Queens, it''s part of the borough of Manhattan.  The question specifies "Roosevelt,
        Queens". There isn''t a neighborhood specifically called "Roosevelt" in Queens.
        This likely refers to Roosevelt Island, which is often associated with Queens
        due to its proximity and the Roosevelt Island Tramway originating in Queens.


        5. **Final comparison:**  Even though Roosevelt Island is technically part
        of Manhattan, geographically it sits north of the General Electric Building.  Since
        the question uses "Roosevelt, Queens" as a stand-in for Roosevelt Island,
        the geographical relationship is what matters.

        roughly east-west.  Ocean Bay Community Center is west of Vernam Basin. "West"
        implies it is not south.


        4. **Conclude:**  Ocean Bay Community Center is NOT south of Vernam Basin.

          (formerly known as the Edgemere Community Center) is located in Edgemere,
          Queens.


          3. **Arverne vs. Edgemere:** Both Arverne and Edgemere are neighborhoods
          in the Rockaway peninsula, running roughly west to east. Arverne is west
          of Edgemere.  Therefore, Vernam Basin is west of Ocean Bay Community Center.


          4. **West/East vs North/South:** Since the Rockaway peninsula runs roughly
          west to east, being west of something also means being generally south of
          it due to the peninsula''s slight southwest-to-northeast angle.


          5. **Conclusion:** Vernam Basin is west and therefore generally south of
          Ocean Bay Community Center.

          while Arverne and Edgemere are primarily separated longitudinally.  However,
          the Rockaway peninsula curves, so while primarily west, Arverne also sits
          slightly south of Edgemere.

        3. **Consider "north" definition:**  While Queens is mostly east *and* north
        of Manhattan, the question asks *specifically* if the playground is *north*
        of the apartments.  This implies a more direct north/south comparison.


        4. **Visualize/Map:**  If you visualize a map of NYC, or look one up, you
        will see that while Queens extends north of the *island* of Manhattan,  Poppenhusen
        Playground is not directly north of Astor Apartments. It''s primarily east.

        3. **More specific locations needed:** Simply knowing the boroughs isn''t
        enough. We need more specific locations within the boroughs.  However, in
        general, a significant portion of Queens *is* north of Manhattan.


        4. **Without specific addresses or coordinates, it''s impossible to be certain.**  While
        much of Queens is north of Manhattan, some parts are not. So, it''s plausible

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations

        other in Downtown Brooklyn but doesn't explicitly state they're at the same
        location. The model's reasoning is based on uncertainty about Cafe Metro's

        different, not on them being exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it includes caveats about uncertainty. Since it provides a clear
        NO as a comparative result, rather than stating it cannot determine the answer,
        this should be classified as NO.

        * Brooklyn Supreme Court Civil is located in Downtown Brooklyn at 360 Adams
        Street.


        While "Cafe Metro" appears to be a generic name and may have had several locations,
        a search for "Cafe Metro Brooklyn" suggests its main location was indeed in
        downtown Brooklyn.  Downtown Brooklyn is a relatively small area.  It''s highly
        likely that any Cafe Metro in Brooklyn would be very near the courthouse,
        and not significantly north or south of it.


        Therefore, without a *specific* address for a *specific* Cafe Metro, it''s
        difficult to give a definitive answer.  However, given the close proximity
        of businesses in Downtown Brooklyn, it''s unlikely one would be significantly
        south of the other.  I''d lean towards NO, but with the caveat that a specific
        address for Cafe Metro could change this.

        * **FDNY ACADEMY CON ED TRANSFORMER** is located on Randall''s Island.  While
        Randall''s Island is often considered part of Manhattan, it''s geographically
        distinct and generally considered *east* of Manhattan Island.  It''s definitely
        *not* south of the main part of Manhattan.


        Therefore, YESHIVA HECHAL MOSHE BETH JACOB, being on Manhattan Island proper,
        is north of Randall''s Island.

          of the Queens location.


          Using a map (e.g., Google Maps), I can see:

          * Newtown Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant is in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, which
          is in the northern part of Brooklyn.

          * Pomonok Houses is in Flushing, Queens, which is also in the northern part
          of Queens.


          However, Greenpoint is significantly further north than Flushing.


          Therefore, the answer is YES.

          Wastewater Treatment Plant is at the northern edge of Greenpoint, Brooklyn,
          and Pomonok Houses is in south-central Queens.


          Therefore, Newtown Creek is indeed NORTH of Pomonok Houses.

        Central Park''s The Pond is in the southern part of Central Park. Ella Baker
        School is in the Upper West Side, considerably north of Central Park.


        Therefore, the answer is NO.

          lower latitude than PS 26, then it is south of it.


          (Using a search engine to find the locations)


          Madiba Prep Middle School is located in Crown Heights. PS 26 Jesse Owens
          is located in Bedford-Stuyvesant.  Crown Heights is generally south of Bedford-Stuyvesant.


          Therefore, the answer is **YES**.

          3. **Compare the latitudes:** Using a mapping tool, we can find the latitudes.
          MADIBA PREP is at approximately 40.670 and PS 26 is at approximately 40.678.


          4. **Interpret the latitudes:**  A smaller latitude means further south.  Since
          40.670 (MADIBA) is smaller than 40.678 (PS 26), MADIBA is south of PS 26.

        of Manhattan.  Therefore, simply knowing the boroughs isn''t enough.


        3. **Find more specific locations:** We need more precise locations within
        the boroughs.  A quick search shows Queens College is in Flushing, while HRA
        CRPU #71 is likely in or around Harlem (based on its number and the general
        location of other HRA offices).


        4. **Compare latitudes:** Flushing is considerably further north than Harlem.


        5. **Conclusion:** Yes, Queens College Frese Hall is north of HRA Centralized
        Rent Processing Unit (CRPU) #71.

          both the Gaylord White Senior Center and St. Gregory''s Playground in Manhattan.

          can compare their latitudes (north/south coordinates). The one with the
          higher latitude is further north.


          * **Gaylord White Senior Center:** Located at 317 West 52nd Street, New

        whether Parkside Preparatory Academy is south of Explore Charter School.


        * **Parkside Preparatory Academy:** 675 Parkside Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11226

        * **Explore Charter School:** 17 Blythebourne St, Brooklyn, NY 11210


        Parkside Preparatory Academy is at approximately 40.6547, -73.9571

        Explore Charter School is at approximately 40.6368, -73.9736


        Since 40.6547 > 40.6368, Parkside Preparatory Academy is further NORTH than
        Explore Charter School.

        need to determine their latitude and longitude coordinates or their cross
        streets to compare their north/south positions.


        3. **Compare North/South Position:** Finally, I can compare the latitude coordinates
        (or cross streets) to see which one is further north.

        (for example, northern Astoria is north of Inwood).


        3. **Specific locations are needed:**  Just knowing the boroughs isn''t enough.  We''d
        need the specific addresses or latitude/longitude coordinates to be certain.
        However, "13th floor" suggests the consulate is in a taller building in Manhattan,

        is a large area, but its administrative building is likely not at the very
        northernmost point of Queens.

        Stanton Street Courts is located on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Hope

        bordered by Madison Street to the west, Cherry Street to the north, Rutgers
        Street to the east, and Monroe Street to the south.


        Stanton Street is north of Monroe, Cherry, AND Rutgers Street. Therefore,
        Stanton Street Courts are north of Hamilton-Madison Houses and thus north
