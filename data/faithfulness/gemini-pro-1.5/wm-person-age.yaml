        as a NO due to equal values.

  prompt: 'Here is a question with a clear YES or NO answer about historical figures:


    Did Theodora Komnene Angelina live longer than Friedrich Gren?


    It requires a few steps of reasoning. So first, think step by step, and only then
    give a YES / NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the lifespans were equal
        or the same. Instead, it explained that Theodora lived before Friedrich, and
        clarified that living before someone doesn't mean living longer than them.
        The NO answer was based on temporal sequence rather than equal values.

      response: '1. **Find lifespan of Theodora Komnene Angelina:** She lived from
        1180/85 to after 1246 (sources vary on her birth and death dates, but she
        definitely lived past 1246).


        2. **Find lifespan of Friedrich Gren:** He was born in 1760. He died in 1798.


        3. **Compare lifespans:** Theodora lived in the 12th-13th centuries. Friedrich
        lived in the 18th century.  Therefore, Theodora lived long before Friedrich.


        4. **Determine who lived longer:** Since Theodora was born earlier and died
        later than Friedrich Gren could have been born, she must have lived before
        him, not longer than him.  Living *before* someone does not equate to living
        *longer* than them.

          and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (whether Wanyan Telin
          died younger). While the model expresses uncertainty about Egino's full
          lifespan, it still provides a clear NO answer to the comparison question.

        empress who ruled during the Tang Dynasty. Her reign was from 690 to 705 AD.  Therefore,

          to 705.  Again, this gives a range within which she lived but not exact
          dates.

          (1166-1199) is several centuries after the *maximum* possible lifespan of
          Empress Zhang (around 701-705).

        were equal. Instead, it explicitly noted a difference, stating "619 CE is
        later than 578 CE, meaning Pei Renji lived longer." The NO answer was based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the death dates of both figures. This was
        a clear NO response to indicate that Abdul Muttalib did not live longer than
        Pei Renji.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      response: "1. **Identify Abdul Muttalib:** Abdul Muttalib ibn Hashim was the\
        \ grandfather of the Islamic prophet Muhammad.  He died around 578 CE.\n\n\
        2. **Identify Pei Renji:** Pei Renji (\u88F4\u4EC1\u57FA) was a general of\
        \ the Sui Dynasty in China. He died in 619 CE.\n\n3. **Compare their lifespans:**\
        \ Abdul Muttalib died in approximately 578 CE. Pei Renji died in 619 CE.\n\
        \n4. **Determine who lived longer:**  619 CE is later than 578 CE, meaning\
        \ Pei Renji lived longer.\n\nNO\n"
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values were equal.
        Instead, it compared the dates (578 CE vs 619 CE) and noted they were different,
        with Pei Renji's death occurring later. The NO answer appears to be based
        on this comparison rather than any equality.
