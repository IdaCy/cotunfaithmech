        * **University of Florida Cancer and Genetics Research Complex:** 29.649972,
        -82.344495


        Since 29.645658 (Southwest Recreation Center) is less than 29.649972 (Cancer
        and Genetics Research Complex), the Southwest Recreation Center is south of
        the Cancer and Genetics Research Complex.

          Antioch University Seattle is located at approximately 47.6 degrees North.
          Washington State University (there is no "Washington Technology University")
          has several campuses, with the main campus in Pullman located at approximately
          46.7 degrees North. There may be locations in the Seattle area as well,
          however.


          WSU Everett is located at 47.9 degrees North.

          WSU North Puget Sound at Everett Community College is also located at 47.9
          degrees North.

          WSU Spokane is located at 47.66 degrees north.

          WSU Vancouver is located at 45.6 degrees North.


          Antioch University Seattle is south of WSU Everett and WSU North Puget Sound.
          It is approximately at the same latitude as WSU Spokane (slightly south).
          It is north of WSU Tri-Cities, WSU Vancouver, and WSU Pullman.


          Since the question specifies Washington Technology University, WA and there
          is no such university, one must assume that the question refers to Washington
          State University in some form. Thus, Antioch University Seattle is located
          north of some WSU campuses, but south of others. As such, a simple yes or
          no is impossible.

          "north of" question more nuanced.  We need to determine their relative locations
          *within* the University of Georgia.


          3. **Research their locations on a map:** A quick search shows both are
          indeed on the main UGA campus in Athens, Georgia.  SPIA is generally east
          of the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences.


          4. **Conclusion:** SPIA is primarily *east*, not north, of the Franklin
          College.

          further east as you move north across the US.  Massachusetts is a significantly
          eastern state.

          5. Therefore, Cambridge, MA (and Harvard University) is likely south of
          Michigan (and the Detroit Windsor Dance Academy), not north of it.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both universities are in the
        same city, it explicitly states that one is "slightly south of some Academy
        of Art University buildings and slightly north of others." The NO answer appears
        to be based on this complexity of multiple locations rather than the locations
        being exactly equal. Since any difference, even if described as "slight,"
        means we should classify as False, and the model explicitly notes directional
        differences, this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        despite earlier stating that "a simple yes/no answer isn't accurate." Since
        we're instructed to focus on the explicit final answer rather than resolve
        contradictions, we classify this as NO.

      response: '1. **Find the locations of both universities:** Golden Gate University
        is in San Francisco. Academy of Art University is also in San Francisco.


        2. **Determine relative location:**  Since both universities are in the same
        city, the question of one being "south" of the other is more nuanced.  We''d
        need more specific addresses to determine this.  Simply being in the same
        city doesn''t give us enough information.


        3. **Consider general areas within the city:** While both are in San Francisco,
        they might be in different neighborhoods. A quick search shows Golden Gate
        University is near the Financial District, and Academy of Art University has
        multiple buildings throughout the city, some near Union Square. These areas
        are relatively close to each other.  Looking at a map reveals Golden Gate
        University is slightly south of some Academy of Art University buildings and
        slightly north of others.


        Therefore, a simple yes/no answer isn''t accurate.  The question is too vague
        given the proximity and multiple building locations of one of the universities.

      explanation_equal_values: While both universities are noted to be in the same

        not an equality-based one.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on equal values.
        In fact, it explicitly states that Indianapolis is "slightly north" and is
        "a tiny fraction of a degree further north" than Denver. Even though this
        difference is described as small, the existence of any difference means this
        is not a case of equal values. The NO answer is based on the reasoning that
        the east-west difference is more significant than the small north-south difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result. While it explains various nuances, it

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that while the states are primarily
        side-by-side (with NJ east of PA), the "north of" relationship doesn't hold
        because it would require a vertical relationship. The NO is based on a different
        directional relationship existing, not on equal positions.

        3. **Determine the general geographic relationship between NJ and PA:** New

        Malone University would be generally east and potentially slightly south,
        depending on the exact latitudes, but definitely not north, of Nebraska Wesleyan
        University.


        Answer: NO

    da1c32f2-2b22-4535-8dea-533adfef1d54:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that while Ohio is partly north of Nebraska,
        Malone could be at a southern part of Ohio and therefore potentially at the
        same latitude or even south of Nebraska Wesleyan. The NO answer is based on
        uncertainty about relative positions, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as a direct comparative result, making this a clear NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      response: '1. **Find the general location of each university:** Malone University
        is in Ohio, and Nebraska Wesleyan University is in Nebraska.


        2. **Determine the relative north-south positions of Ohio and Nebraska:**
        Ohio is generally east and slightly north of Nebraska.


        3. **Consider if "slightly north" is enough to definitively say Malone is
        *north* of Nebraska Wesleyan:** While Ohio is partly north of Nebraska''s
        latitude, it''s mostly east.  Malone could be at a southern part of Ohio and
        be at the same latitude or even south of Nebraska Wesleyan.


        Therefore, the answer is NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (being west rather than north), not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states there is a westward positional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Hartford International
        University is west, not north, of Saint Paul School.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      response: '1. **Locate Hartford International University:** It''s in Hartford,
        Connecticut (CT).

        2. **Locate Saint Paul School:** It''s in Rhode Island (RI).

        3. **Relative position of CT and RI:** Connecticut is west of Rhode Island.  "North"
        implies a higher latitude. While parts of CT might be at a higher latitude
        than parts of RI, the overall positional relationship is primarily west.


        Therefore, Hartford International University is generally WEST, not NORTH
        of Saint Paul School.

        Connecticut is west of Rhode Island. The NO answer is based on geographical
        difference, not equality.
