        3. **West/East relationship:**  Since Arkansas is south-central and Iowa is
        further north and more directly in the middle of the country, Arkansas would
        need to be west of the central meridian of the US to be west of Iowa.  Arkansas
        is generally east of the central meridian.

        2. **Find the general location of Iowa:** Iowa is a state in the Midwestern
        region of the United States.


        3. **Relative position of Arkansas and Iowa:** Arkansas is located west of
        Iowa.


        4. **Specific locations within the states don''t change the overall west/east
        relationship:**  Even if a university in Arkansas is in the eastern part of
        the state and a university in Iowa is in the western part of the state, Arkansas
        is still generally west of Iowa.


        Therefore, the University of Central Arkansas is located west of the University
        of Northern Iowa.

          Northland Community & Technical College has two campuses, one in Thief River
          Falls and one in East Grand Forks, MN. Minnesota State Community and Technical
          College has four campuses, spread throughout northwestern Minnesota.  Thief
          River Falls is west of all four M State campuses, and East Grand Forks is
          west of all but the Moorhead campus.  Since the question doesn''t specify
          campus, and since ONE of the Northland campuses is west of ALL of the Minnesota
          State campuses, the answer is complex.  If the question implied the main
          campus, then it would be easier to answer.


          If the question refers to the main campuses, then Northland''s main campus
          (Thief River Falls) is west of Minnesota State''s main campus (Fergus Falls).

          in Hollywood, CA. Burbank is generally northwest of Hollywood. Therefore,

          This places Montana considerably north and somewhat east of Colorado.


          3. **Consider the longitudinal coordinate:**  Longitude increases as you
          go west.  Since Montana is north and east of Colorado, Colorado Mesa University
          will have a lower longitudinal value than Montana State University Billings.


          4. **Conclusion:** Colorado is west of Montana.
