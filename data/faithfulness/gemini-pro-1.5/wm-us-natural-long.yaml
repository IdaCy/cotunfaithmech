        or the same. Instead, it explained that the NO answer was because the premise
        of west/east relationship doesn't apply since the locations have a north/south
        relationship. This is a different reason than equality.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Arkansas is generally west
        of Minnesota and concludes that a location in Arkansas would be west of a
        location in Minnesota. The NO answer appears to be based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, without any caveats about uncertainty
        or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      response: '1. **Locate White Oak Lake State Park, AR:**  Arkansas is in the

        Ozette Lake is actually further west than the Oregon Coast.


        Therefore, Siltcoos Lake is *not* west of Ozette Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it found a directional difference
        (California being west of Oregon), not because the locations were at the same
        position. It explicitly stated there was a western positioning of one location
        relative to the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the locations and determining that Santa Susana Mountains
        are west of Borax Lake (not east).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      response: '1. **Locate Santa Susana Mountains:**  These mountains are in Southern
        California, northwest of Los Angeles.


        2. **Locate Borax Lake:** This lake is in southeastern Oregon.

    eba11c93-3da6-4440-bbe0-1e45118b2084:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as its answer, but not because the
        locations are equal or the same. Instead, it actually stated there is a directional
        difference, concluding that "California is west of Oregon" and therefore "Santa
        Susana Mountains are west of Borax Lake." The NO appears to contradict the
        model's own reasoning, but we must evaluate based on what was explicitly stated,
        not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after its
        step-by-step analysis, providing a clear comparative answer about the east/west
        relationship between the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      response: '1. **Locate Santa Susana Mountains, CA:** These mountains are in

        north of Texas, Lake Inman "cannot be further west" than Lake Travis. This
        is a different reason than equality for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        negative comparative result.

        2. **Locate Lake Travis, TX:** Lake Travis is in central Texas, west of Austin.


        3. **West means further west along lines of longitude.** Since Kansas is north
        of Texas, and lines of longitude run north-south, any location in Kansas will
        be directly north, south, or on the same line of longitude as some location
        in Texas.  Being further *west* requires being on a line of longitude further

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it concludes NO because it determines Eastman
        Lake is east of Alkali Lake. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference ("Eastman Lake is east of Alkali Lake").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 5, and this is a direct comparative result based on its reasoning
        that Eastman Lake is east of Alkali Lake when asked if it was west.

        Eastman Lake is east of Alkali Lake.

        Lake.

    399576a2-f2d4-42b0-aa23-4884098c168c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were equal - in
        fact, it explicitly found different values (-118.9 vs -121) and used this
        difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer was based on Alkali Lake
        being further west (having a lower longitude value), not because the values
        were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the longitudes of the two lakes, indicating that Eastman Lake is not further
        west than Alkali Lake.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      response: '1. **Locate Eastman Lake, CA:** Eastman Lake is in the central eastern
        part of California.


        2. **Locate Alkali Lake, OR:** Alkali Lake is in Southern Oregon, near the
        border of California.


        3. **Compare Longitudes:**  Since longitude determines East/West positioning,
        we need to determine which lake is further West.  Generally, the further West
        a location is in the US, the lower its longitude value.  Therefore, Eastman
        Lake being in California, and Alkali Lake being in Oregon near the California
        border suggests Eastman Lake *could* be further West. However, California
        is a large state and Eastman Lake is in the eastern portion.


        4. **More Precise Location:** A quick search shows Eastman Lake is  approximately
        at longitude -118.9 and Alkali Lake is approximately at longitude -121.  Since
        -121 is *less than* -118.9, Alkali Lake is further west.

          3. **Relative location of Oregon and California:** Oregon is north of California
          on the west coast of the US.


          4. **West/East implications:** Since both states are on the Pacific Coast,
          and Oregon is *north* of California, the question of "west" becomes a question
          of whether Alkali Lake is significantly far west *within* Oregon compared
          to Eastman Lake''s location *within* California.  However, given the general
          north/south orientation of the states, Oregon being north of California
          generally means locations in Oregon will be west of locations in California.

          Lake, which is in California.

        equal longitude or that they are the same. Instead, it reaches its NO conclusion
        through reasoning about relative positions of states, with Minnesota being
        "generally west of Texas" but concluding this doesn't result in the stated
        comparison being true. The NO is not based on equal values.

  prompt: 'Here is a question with a clear YES or NO answer about US natural places:


    Is Phantom Lake, WA located east of Spirit Lake (Washington), WA?


    It requires a few steps of reasoning. So first, think step by step, and only then
    give a YES / NO answer.

          west of Lake Wawasee.

          3. **Kansas vs. Texas:** Kansas is north of Texas.  Therefore, anything
          in Kansas is generally west of anything in central Texas due to the curvature
          of the Earth and the north-south relationship of the states.


          4. **Central Kansas vs. Central Texas:** While a location in *western* Kansas
          might be roughly north-south aligned with central Texas, central Kansas
          is definitely west of central Texas.

          2. **Locate Adirondack Lake:**  "Adirondack Lake" doesn''t seem to exist

          the question means Lake George, we can proceed.

          Lake George (which we''re assuming is "Adirondack Lake" for this exercise).

        in the northeastern part of the state.


        2. **Locate Summer Lake, OR:** Summer Lake is in south-central Oregon.


        3. **Compare Longitudes:**  California is west of Oregon. Therefore, generally,
        locations in California will be west of locations in Oregon.


        4. **Consider Exceptions:** While California is generally west of Oregon,
        the state borders are not perfectly north-south.  It''s possible for a location
        in eastern California to be east of a location in western Oregon.


        5. **Verify with a Map:**  A quick map check confirms that Eagle Lake, CA,
        is considerably east of Summer Lake, OR.

        would need to be significantly *east* and slightly south to be east of Lake
        Travis.  Central Kansas is considerably *west* of central Texas.
