          of Ohio.

          3. **Zip Code Logic:** Lower zip codes generally indicate a more western
          location in the US. 43125 is a lower number than 46235. This suggests 43125,
          OH might be further west than 46235, IN, supporting the idea that 46235,
          IN could be north.

          4. **Need for Precise Location:** While general geography and zip code logic
          offer clues, they don''t guarantee a definitive answer.  We need to check
          the actual locations of these zip codes.  A quick online search confirms
          46235 (Indianapolis area) is indeed north of 43125 (near Columbus, Ohio).

          3. **Latitude is the key:**  Since we''re talking North and South, we need

          4. **Lookup or General Knowledge:** A quick online search or general knowledge
          of the Midwest tells us that Indiana is generally further north than Ohio.
          Indianapolis (in Indiana) is noticeably north of Columbus (in Ohio), for
          instance.

          latitudes, general knowledge suggests Indianapolis (in Indiana, where 46235

        response: '1. **Find the latitude and longitude of 79925, TX:** This zip code
          corresponds to El Paso, Texas. El Paso is located in far West Texas.


          2. **Find the latitude and longitude of 36037, AL:** This zip code corresponds
          to an area near Montgomery, Alabama. Montgomery is in central Alabama.


          3. **Compare the latitudes:**  Latitude determines how far north or south
          a location is.  Since El Paso is significantly further west than Montgomery,
          we need to focus on latitude. El Paso is further north than Montgomery.


          4. **Determine north/south relationship:** Higher latitude values correspond
          to locations further north.  Since El Paso is further north than Montgomery,
          79925, TX is north of 36037, AL.

          the general north/south positioning of the states is a strong indicator.  Looking
          up the zip codes confirms this: 64082 is in Platte City, MO and 22042 is
          in Falls Church, VA.

        While not a perfect system, lower zip codes tend to be on the east coast.  Since

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explains that Illinois is generally
        east and slightly north of Kansas, and while there might be some exceptions
        due to their shared border, it maintains there are directional differences.
        The NO answer appears to be based on these geographical relationships rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        without any qualifications about inability to determine or verify. This is
        a clear NO comparative result.

      response: '1. **Find the states:** IL is Illinois, and KS is Kansas.

        2. **General locations of the states:** Illinois is generally east and slightly
        north of Kansas.

        3. **Implication of location:**  Since Illinois is north of Kansas, a location
        in Illinois is likely north of a location in Kansas.

        4. **Consider exceptions:** While Illinois is generally north of Kansas, the
        states share a small border. It''s possible that a southern point in Illinois
        could be slightly south of a northern point in Kansas. However, the general
        trend of Illinois being north of Kansas is strong.

          2. **Determine the relative north/south positions of the states:** West
          Virginia is generally north of Maryland. Though some parts of Maryland might
          be on the same latitude as some parts of WV, generally, WV is north.

          3. **Consider if the specific zip codes contradict the general trend:**  While
          some parts of Maryland might extend further north than some parts of West
          Virginia, it''s unlikely given the general location of the two states.  Looking
          up the zip codes confirms that 26301 (Morgantown, WV) is indeed significantly
          north of 21229 (Baltimore, MD).

          3. **North/South vs. East/West:** The question asks about "north of."  While
          Georgia and California are separated significantly east/west, their latitudes
          (north/south position) are closer.  However, Georgia is generally north
          of the southernmost parts of California.

        south of Ohio (OH).

        2. **Zip code logic:** Lower numbered zip codes are generally further west
        and/or south.  43125 is a lower number than 46235.

        3. **Combining information:** Since IN is already slightly south of OH, and
        46235 is a higher number (meaning further north/east) than 43125, it''s unlikely
        that 46235, IN is south of 43125, OH.

        for each zip code (e.g., latitude/longitude lookup).  However, given that
        Indiana is generally south and west of Ohio, and the relatively small difference
        in zip codes, it''s *likely* 46235, IN is still south of 43125, OH.  But this
        is not certain without more data.


        **Answer:**  Leaning towards YES, but not definitively without more information.  A
        proper check would involve looking up the latitude of each zip code.

          much further south than most of Florida.

          5. **Conclusion:**  Parts of Texas are south of Florida, and it''s likely
          78653 is south of 32507.  Confirming with a map or zip code lookup would
          be ideal.  However, based on general geography, it''s highly probable.

        response: '1. **Find the latitude of 85250, AZ:** This zip code corresponds
          to Scottsdale, Arizona. Scottsdale is generally north of Phoenix, which

        suggests 67101 (KS) is further east than 62918 (IL).  This reinforces the

          zip code in WI will have a higher latitude than any zip code in OR.

          comparing locations this far apart.

          3. **Specific Latitude Knowledge (helpful but not strictly required):**
          Colorado is known to be further north than Pennsylvania in general.


          Therefore, YES, 80526, CO is located north of 16652, PA.

          2. **General US geography:** Colorado is west of Pennsylvania.  Latitude

          Since these states are far apart on longitude, the north/south comparison
          is less straightforward and less impactful than the east/west difference.  However,
          Colorado is generally north of the *southern* portion of Pennsylvania.

          zip code lookup).  Assuming we find that 72904, AR has a higher latitude
          than 27505, NC, then 72904, AR is north of 27505, NC.  If 72904, AR has
