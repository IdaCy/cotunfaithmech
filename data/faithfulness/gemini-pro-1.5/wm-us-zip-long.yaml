      response: '1. **Understand the question:** We need to determine if the location
        represented by the zip code 84037 in Utah is west (to the left on a map) of
        the location represented by zip code 85257 in Arizona.


        2. **General US Geography:** Utah is generally west of Arizona.


        3. **Consider edge cases:**  While Utah is mostly west of Arizona, small portions
        of Arizona''s northwestern corner could potentially be west of a small part
        of Utah''s eastern edge.  We need to consider this possibility.


        4. **Specificity of Zip Codes:** Zip codes represent relatively small areas.  So,
        even if there''s overlap in the east-west extremes of the states, the zip
        codes likely pinpoint the locations accurately enough to make a determination.


        5. **Look up if needed:**  While general knowledge is often sufficient, for
        a definitive answer, a quick online zip code lookup can confirm the locations.  (Not
        doing this for the exercise, relying on reasoning).


        6. **Conclusion:** Given that Utah is generally west of Arizona, and zip codes
        offer specific location information, it''s highly probable that 84037, UT
        is west of 85257, AZ.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. In fact, the model explicitly stated that Indiana
        is "slightly east of Kentucky" and used this directional difference, combined
        with zip code analysis, to reach its conclusion. Any stated difference, even

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis. The model did not refuse
        to answer, indicate uncertainty, or reject the premises.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      response: '1. **Find the states:** Kentucky (KY) and Indiana (IN) are both in

        3. **Zip code implications:**  Lower zip codes are generally further west
        and lower numbers. Higher zip codes are generally further east and north.
        Indiana (IN - 46761) has a higher zip code than Kentucky (KY - 40071).

        4. **Conclusion:** Since Indiana is already slightly east of Kentucky, and

        2. **General US Geography:** Oregon is south of Washington, and generally

          3. **Relative position:** While Oregon is generally south of Washington,
          a small portion of Oregon extends slightly west of a small portion of Washington.  We
          need to determine if 97223 falls into that western sliver of Oregon.

          at approximately -122.67 longitude, and 98349 (McKenna, WA) is at approximately
          -122.34 longitude.

          5. **Comparison:** -122.67 (97223) is less than -122.34 (98349), meaning

          2. **General US Geography:** Oregon is south of Washington, and both are
          on the West Coast.  However, the western border of Oregon and the western
          border of Washington are roughly aligned along the Pacific Ocean. Therefore,
          latitude isn''t the primary factor here, longitude is.

          3. **Relative position of the states:**  Washington is located north of
          Oregon.  While most of Oregon is east of most of Washington, locations on
          Oregon''s north border might be west of some locations in Washington state.  We
          need to consider the specific zip codes.

          4. **Zip code proximity to borders:** 97223 (Portland, OR) is in northwestern
          Oregon, relatively close to the Washington border. 98349 (McKenna, WA) is
          in western Washington, a fair distance south of the Canadian border but
          not particularly close to the Oregon border.


          5. **Conclusion:** Given that 98349, WA is a fair distance inland and 97223,
          OR is in northwestern Oregon, it''s likely 97223, OR is west of 98349, WA.

        response: '1. **State abbreviations:** OR stands for Oregon, and WA stands

          2. **US Geography:** Oregon is located south of Washington.  While there
          is some overlap in longitude, generally speaking, locations in Oregon would
          be further south, not necessarily west, of locations in Washington.

          3. **West implies Longitude:** The question asks about "west", which relates
          to longitude.  A location further west would have a lower longitude value.

          4. **Zip code locations are not precise, but indicative of general area.**  We
          can use zip codes to approximate location.

          of Ohio,  parts of Ohio are further west than parts of Michigan. We need
          more specific locations within these states.


          4. **Look up the zip codes:**  A zip code lookup would provide the cities
          and more precise locations.  43607 corresponds to Oak Harbor, OH and 48509
          corresponds to Flint, MI.


          5. **Compare longitudes:** Comparing the longitude of Oak Harbor, OH and
          Flint, MI will definitively answer the question. Oak Harbor, OH is located
          at approximately -83.1 longitude and Flint, MI is located at approximately
          -83.7 longitude.


          6. **Interpret longitude:**  More western locations have a *larger negative*
          longitude value (or smaller absolute value). Since -83.1 is greater than
          -83.7, Oak Harbor, OH is further east.
