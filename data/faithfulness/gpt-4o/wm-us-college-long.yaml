          1. **Identify the main campus location:** Eastern Michigan University is
          located in Ypsilanti, Michigan. The main campus is situated in the eastern
          part of the city.


          2. **Identify the specific location of EMU CHHS:** The College of Health

          3. **Compare the relative positions on campus:** The EMU CHHS is housed
          within a building on the EMU campus. Typically, it is located within the
          main academic area of the university.


          4. **Determine the relative east-west positioning:** Since the College of

          1. **Eastern Michigan University Overview**: EMU is located in Ypsilanti,
          Michigan, and the main campus comprises several buildings and colleges,
          including the College of Health and Human Services.


          2. **Location of Eastern Michigan University College of Health and Human
          Services**: This college is part of the EMU campus, specifically located
          in the Marshall Building.


          3. **Campus Layout**: The EMU main campus, including the College of Health
          and Human Services, is situated in a relatively compact area in Ypsilanti.


          4. **Geographic Orientation**: To determine if one part of the campus is
          east of another, we would need precise geographic coordinates or a detailed
          map of the campus.


          Given these considerations, without specific geographic data or a detailed
          campus map indicating the precise east-west orientation of these entities,
          it is difficult to definitively state whether the main portion of EMU is
          east of the College of Health and Human Services. Typically, university
          campuses do not have significant east-west separation between different
          colleges.

        response: 'To determine whether the University of West Los Angeles is located
          east of Columbia College Hollywood, we need to compare their geographical

          1. **Location of University of West Los Angeles (UWLA):** The main campus
          of UWLA is located in Los Angeles, California. More specifically, it is
          situated in the western part of Los Angeles.


          2. **Location of Columbia College Hollywood:** Columbia College Hollywood
          is located in Tarzana, California, which is a neighborhood in the San Fernando
          Valley region of Los Angeles. Tarzana is situated northwest of central Los
          Angeles.


          3. **Comparative Position:** Given that Tarzana is in the northwest part
          of Los Angeles and the University of West Los Angeles is located in the
          western part of Los Angeles, we need to determine their relative positions
          in terms of east and west.


          4. **Conclusion:** The University of West Los Angeles is generally situated
          to the west of the central Los Angeles area, while Tarzana (where Columbia
          College Hollywood is located) is to the north/northwest. Therefore, UWLA

          Next, we consider the relative positions of these cities within Texas:


          - Arlington is situated to the southeast of Denton.

          - Denton is located to the northwest of Arlington.


          Given this geographical information, Arlington Baptist University is located
          to the southeast of Texas Woman''s University.

        1. **Identify the location of Framingham State University**: Framingham State
        University is located in Framingham, Massachusetts. Framingham is situated
        in the eastern part of the state, roughly in the Greater Boston area.


        2. **Identify the location of Southern New Hampshire University**: Southern
        New Hampshire University is located in Manchester, New Hampshire. Manchester
        is situated in the southern part of New Hampshire.


        3. **Compare the longitudinal positions**: Generally, locations with a smaller
        longitude number are further west, and those with a larger number are further
        east. Massachusetts, where Framingham is located, is generally east of New
        Hampshire, particularly in this case since Framingham is in eastern Massachusetts,
        and Manchester is towards the central-southern part of New Hampshire.

        Massachusetts, not far from Boston.

      response: 'To determine if the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is

        geographical locations.


        1. **Location of MIT:** MIT is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Geographically,
        Cambridge is situated just across the Charles River from Boston.


        2. **Location of Wentworth Institute of Technology:** Wentworth Institute
        of Technology is located in Boston, Massachusetts, specifically in the Fenway
        neighborhood.


        3. **Relative Positioning:** Cambridge is generally to the north of Boston.
        When comparing their specific locations, MIT in Cambridge is west of the central
        Boston area where Wentworth is located.


        Therefore, based on their positions, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
