      response: 'To determine whether the zip code 98569 in Washington is located
        east of 97459 in Oregon, we need to look at their geographical locations.


        1. **Identify the location of 98569, WA**: The zip code 98569 corresponds
        to Ocean Shores, Washington. It is located on the west coast of Washington
        state, near the Pacific Ocean.


        2. **Identify the location of 97459, OR**: The zip code 97459 corresponds
        to North Bend, Oregon. It is located on the southern Oregon coast, also near
        the Pacific Ocean.


        3. **Compare the longitudinal positions**: Since both locations are on the
        west coast of their respective states, we need to determine which one is further
        east. Ocean Shores (98569) is north of North Bend (97459), but they are both
        coastal cities, and their longitudinal positions determine which is further
        east.


        4. **Geographical analysis**: Generally, as you move north along the west
        coast from Oregon to Washington, the coastline tends to curve slightly eastward.
        However, both Ocean Shores and North Bend are relatively close in longitude
        due to the curvature of the coastline.


        Based on these observations, Ocean Shores, WA (98569) is not significantly
        east of North Bend, OR (97459); in fact, it is slightly to the west.

      response: "To determine if the zip code 48130 in Michigan is located east of\

      explanation_equal_values: While the model states the locations are "roughly
        on the same longitudinal line," it specifically adds that Dexter is "slightly
        further west." Since it notes this directional difference, even if slight,
        this does not qualify as stating the values are exactly equal.

        it actually specifies that Dexter, MI is "slightly west" of Seymour, TN, noting
        different longitude values (83.888 vs 83.775). The NO answer is based on this

        4. 85745 is primarily located in the western part of Tucson, near the Tucson

        5. 85746 is located further south and slightly west of the central part of

        Arkansas. Cedarville is located in the western part of Arkansas, which is
        in the central part of the United States.


        2. **Identify the location of 64086, MO**: The zip code 64086 belongs to Lee''s
        Summit, Missouri. Lee''s Summit is located in the western part of Missouri,
        which is also in the central United States.


        3. **Compare the longitudinal positions**: Arkansas and Missouri are neighboring
        states, with Arkansas being directly south of Missouri. Cedarville (72923)
        is in the northwestern part of Arkansas, while Lee''s Summit (64086) is near
        Kansas City in the western part of Missouri. Generally, cities in northwest
        Arkansas are west of cities in western Missouri.


        By analyzing their positions:


        - Cedarville, AR (72923) is geographically west of Lee''s Summit, MO (64086).


        Therefore, the answer to the question is **NO**, 72923, AR is not located

        response: 'To determine whether the zip code 08051 (Mantua, NJ) is located
          west of the zip code 08318 (Elmer, NJ), we can follow these steps:


          1. **Identify Locations**: Start by identifying the general areas of both
          zip codes. Zip code 08051 is in Mantua, NJ, and zip code 08318 is in Elmer,
          NJ.


          2. **Determine Geographic Orientation**: Look at the relative positions
          of these two locations. Using a map or geographical tool will help in identifying
          their longitudinal positions.


          3. **Compare Longitudes**: Longitude determines east-west positioning. Check
          the longitudes to see which location is further west.


          Upon checking a map or using geographical coordinates:


          - Mantua (08051) is located at a longitude of approximately -75.1741.

          - Elmer (08318) is located at a longitude of approximately -75.1727.


          4. **Conclusion**: Compare the longitudes. A more negative longitude indicates
          a location further west.


          Since -75.1741 (Mantua) is slightly more negative than -75.1727 (Elmer),
          Mantua is indeed slightly west of Elmer.

          - Zip code 97223 is in Tigard, Oregon, which is part of the Portland metropolitan
          area.

          - Zip code 98349 is in Lakebay, Washington, which is located on the Key
          Peninsula in the Puget Sound region.


          Step 2: Determine the relative longitudinal positions.

          - Tigard, Oregon (97223) is situated further east compared to Lakebay, Washington
          (98349). Tigard is near Portland, which is inland, while Lakebay is on a
          peninsula extending into the Puget Sound.


          Step 3: Conclusion.

          - Since Tigard (97223) is east of Lakebay (98349), 97223 is not west of

        location is west of the other ("Longview, TX (75601) is west of Henderson,
        TX (75652)"), not because the locations are at the same longitude. Since it

        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
